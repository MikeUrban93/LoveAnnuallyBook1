Sarah talked about her wealthy father's custom of keeping each family member's gifts to a modest monetary value. This sparked Evan and Liz to share one of their own gift traditions, which allowed each family member to open one of their many presents on Christmas Eve. Evan's warm and playful family quickly rubbed off on Sarah. By the end of the scene, she not only playfully retaliated against Liz for her earlier ugly sweater joke but also surprised and delighted everyone by launching a dinner roll at Liz, mimicking an action Liz had taken earlier when joking around with Evan.
