Christmas morning at Liz and Joe's apartment was filled with excitement as gifts were unwrapped. Evan's present to Liz, a first-semester report card with three A's and one B, showcased a GPA increase to 3.2 and symbolized his academic growth thanks to Sarah's help. The most poignant moment occurred when Joe gave Liz the final gift â€“ an engagement ring, accompanying a heartfelt proposal that added a touch of romance to the festive celebration.
