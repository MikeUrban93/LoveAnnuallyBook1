\pard\plain \tx0\fi360\sa120\sl264\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan stood under the dreary clouds, a gray blanket unfurling across the morning sky. The location, the same place where he and Sarah first kissed, filled him with a sense of hopeful anticipation. It was Friday, the day after the unforgettable kiss, and he found himself drawn back, a hopeful pilgrim to a shrine of his own making.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 He oscillated between hope and disappointment like a pendulum, his heart racing every time a blonde head appeared in his peripheral vision or the doors to the undergrad library swung open. Yet, each time, it wasn't her. The figure would solidify into a stranger, and the library doors would admit someone else, causing his heart to drop in his chest. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 As the minutes turned into hours, the weather started to mirror his gloom. The rain began, a soft drizzle that escalated steadily, soaking through his jacket. He darted between trees and awnings, attempting to stay dry, but he wouldn't stray far from his post. His need for a direct view of the library doors and the place of their first kiss kept him exposed to the elements. The rain, initially a light mist, grew heavier, each drop echoing his mounting despair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Two hours into his vigil, the figure of Guido appeared. His friend stood next to him, huddled in his own jacket, his eyebrows raised in inquiry. "No luck?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan lowered his gaze, his voice barely audible against the patter of the rain. "No, I haven't seen her."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido clapped a hand on his shoulder, his gruff voice breaking through Evan's reverie. "Sorry, bro. Don't stress it. There are plenty of fish in the sea."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan shook his head. "I don't want to fish in the sea. She's the only one for me."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "You ever consider, bro, that maybe she didn't show up because she has a boyfriend?" Guido turned to Evan, a pragmatic expression etched on his face..}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "I just can't see it, Guido." Evan shook his head, his expression thoughtful.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "You've said she's a stunner, right?" Guido arched a questioning eyebrow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan's eyes softened, his voice quiet. "She transcends stunning. Her face... it's angelic."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "Then isn't it possible some other dude's claimed that angel for himself?" Guido pointed out, punctuating his words with a slight shrug.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "I can't believe she would've kissed me if so. But there's something more..." Evan's gaze drifted off, lost in memory. "The way she looked at me, something in her eyes, it felt like... like she was meant to be mine."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido, bemused by Evan's impassioned response, ribbed him further. "Man, what's so spectacular about this girl? She packin' triple D's or something?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan halted, throwing Guido a pointed look. His tone sharpened, "Guido, knock it off. She's not just some random girl. She's exceptional. Show some respect, dude!"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido raised his hands defensively, a grin still pulling at his lips. "Alright, alright," he said, chuckling slightly. "Didn't mean to ruffle your feathers. My bad." He stepped back slightly, folding his arms across his chest in a mock show of surrender, his fingers tapping a playful beat against his biceps. "I don't get you, dude. You got women lined up to be with you, and you're stressing over a girl whose name you don't know? You should adopt my style \endash  no strings attached, no drama."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "Yeah, and no hope for love," Evan retorted, his voice heavy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido chuckled again, but his tone was softer, almost affectionate. "My friend, ever the hopeless romantic."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan sighed, frustration creeping into his voice. "I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm just... I'm just...just\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85" He trailed off, unable to find the words. After a moment, he added, "I don't know what I am. I just know that I have to see my Cinderella again."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido patted his back again, a grin spreading across his face. "Let's leave the matching glass slipper search for another day. Come on, let's head back to our place. We\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll knock down a few beers and watch baseball. The Cubs actually have a chance for the playoffs this year!"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido's words seemed to echo in the void around Evan, but they didn't seem to stir him from his spot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido persisted, "You'll feel a lot better with a cold brew in your hand and a Cubs victory on the TV. I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll tell you what, after the game, we\u8217\'92ll try to figure a way to get her name."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Still, Evan remained silent, a statue against the rain and gloom.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido's joking tone made a comeback, "How hard can it be to find the most beautiful girl on campus?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 That finally managed to pull a small smile from Evan. "I suppose you're right. I'll bump into her sooner or later."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido nodded, giving Evan's shoulder one last squeeze. "Exactly! Let's chill at home, and we\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll scour the Internet when the game is over."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "Thanks, dude. I feel better already," Evan admitted, and with that, they turned their backs to the library and started the journey home}}
