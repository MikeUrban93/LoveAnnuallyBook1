Sarah discusses her wealthy father's tradition of each family member limiting their gifts to each other 21 at a modest monetary value. This leads to Evan and Liz sharing one of their one-gift traditions. Their tradition is to allow each family member is allowed to open one of their many gifts on Christmas Eve. It hasn't taken long for Evan's affectionate and playful family to infiltrate Sarah. At the end of the scene, not only does she playfully pay back Liz for her ugly sweater tease, but mimicking Liz's earlier action when goofing around Evan, she launches a dinner roll at Liz, to the surprise and delight of everyone.
