\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs26\b0 As the volunteers began to disperse from the worksite, dirty and tired but satisfied, Sarah found herself standing near Evan. She watched him turn down Guido's enthusiastic invitation to the after-work party and caught the spark of determination in his eyes as he talked about coming back the next morning. The tools were put away, the machinery silenced, and the late afternoon sun cast a warm glow on Evan's face as he looked at her. She reached out and touched his arm, her expression one of genuine admiration. "Evan, every time I think I've figured you out, you do something that astonishes me all over again," she said, her voice filled with warmth and respect. "Your willingness to give up your Sunday, your friends, all for this cause, and for our time together... it's truly amazing."}{ }}
