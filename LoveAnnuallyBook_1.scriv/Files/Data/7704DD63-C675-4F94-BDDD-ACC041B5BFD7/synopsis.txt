Sarah was called away to deal with a minor emergency. She instructed Katie to get Evan and Guido to help deliver the food from her car to the hungry volunteers. Joining Evan and the crew for lunch was a 14-year-old boy who lived in the area. Of his own volition, he walked on site and started helping with the cleanup. Seeing he was unsupervised, Evan took Diego under his wing, and they worked together throughout the morning. With the workday half over, lunch was served.
