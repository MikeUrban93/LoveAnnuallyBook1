\pard\plain \tx0\fi360\sa120\sl264\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 <$Scr_Ps::0>At the heart of the warm, inviting dining room was a large wooden table, surrounded by six chairs. Sarah sat next to Evan, who was to her right. Directly across from Sarah, an empty chair awaited the arrival of a mystery guest. Across from Evan, another chair sat empty, but with no place setting to suggest it would be filled. At the opposite ends of the table, Liz was closest to Sarah while Joe sat near Evan.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Liz, Evan, and Joe vanished into the kitchen, leaving Sarah momentarily alone at the table. She listened as sounds of culinary harmony filled the air\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the scrape of a knife against a chopping board, the pop of a wine cork. The trio worked in tandem, a well-practiced choreography of hands and utensils.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Joe emerged first from the kitchen, holding a carving knife and fork. Evan and Liz trailed behind him, carrying salad bowls and wine bottles. Each set their contributions down before resuming their seats. Joe carved the turkey with practiced ease, portioning it onto waiting plates.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Sarah watched, her spine rigid and her movements precise. *Composure, poise, always polite,* whispered the voice of etiquette lessons long past. She had never felt more foreign, observing the heartfelt dynamics of the Vaughn family.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 As they began to eat, Liz looked across the table and said, "So, who's the mystery guest? My money is on a Chicago Bears player."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Joe chuckled. "Better than that."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Evan's eyes widened. "Then it has to be Lefty Loogan!"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Without warning, Liz launched a dinner roll across the table at Evan, who caught it deftly and grinned. "Thanks, sis."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Despite her ingrained restraint, Sarah couldn't help but feel captivated by the playful banter of the Vaughn family. *Oh my, how I have changed.*}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Seizing the momentary lull, Joe turned to Sarah. "Sarah, any guesses?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Sarah whispered her answer, "Guido?" }
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Evan laughed. "Guido? In Philly, last I checked."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 At that moment, a knock on the door jolted everyone to attention. Joe stood and strode to the entrance, a triumphant gleam in his eyes. He opened the door and stepped aside, finally revealing the eagerly-awaited mystery guest.}
