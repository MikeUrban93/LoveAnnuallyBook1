She was late for the first time in her teaching assistant career. When she arrived, she was uncharacteristically frazzled from her first kiss with Evan and started writing on the board material that had not been covered.}

But unsettled by her experience with Evan, she actually taught in a way the students enjoyed and could relate to. Her student got to see that indeed she does have a personality and is not as one-dimensional as they thought.}
