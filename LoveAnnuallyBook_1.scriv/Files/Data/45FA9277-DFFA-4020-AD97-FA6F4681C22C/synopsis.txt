Evan had invited Sarah to watch the Monday night Chicago Bears football game at his softball coach's house. Over a dozen of Evan's friends were also there to watch the game. After the game, they partied with loud music and drinking games, including beer pong. Sarah had felt out of place and had sat quietly next to Evan while everyone else had been drinking and cheering for the Bears.
