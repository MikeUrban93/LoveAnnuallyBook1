They were late for work, and Guido was taking forever in the bathroom, primping and preening as if it were a special occasion. Evan's anxiety level was ratcheting up; he needed to be at the gym by six o'clock for a client session, and time was slipping away. But more than that, he was desperate to share his news with Guido, his best friend.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "Come on, Guido!" Evan called out, knowing that his plea would probably go ignored. Guido's fixation with his appearance was well-known, especially now that there was a new female personal trainer at the gym he wanted to impress.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Finally, Guido emerged from the bathroom, every strand of his hair gelled perfectly into place. "Relax, bro," he said, a grin spreading across his face. "We've got plenty of time."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "You've got plenty of time," Evan corrected, grabbing his keys. "I've got a client session at six, and I need to talk to you about Sarah."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido's eyes widened. "Sarah? What's the big news, bro?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "Not here," Evan said, urging Guido towards the door. "In the car."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido's old Honda Civic roared to life, and as they pulled out of the apartment complex, Evan began to relive his experience with Sarah, detailing every moment of their time together. Guido listened, a bemused expression on his face, concern growing as he realized how infatuated Evan was with this girl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "Dude, you're obsessed," Guido finally interrupted. "I've never seen you like this."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan's face flushed. "I need your help, Guido. How can I make the date special? What should I get her?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido looked at Evan like he'd lost his mind. "How would I know what's special? Special to me is spending the night." He rattled off a list of common gifts: candy, flowers, wine, and lingerie.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan shot down each suggestion, claiming they were either clich\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u233\'E9 or inappropriate for a first date. Guido's patience wore thin, irritation creeping into his voice. "I don't know, dude, you're asking the wrong guy. Get your act together, or she's gonna ditch you ten minutes into the date. You better play cool like 'The Guido.'"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan's face fell, but he knew Guido had a point. He was acting overly enthusiastic, and he needed to reel it in.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "Look, bro," Guido continued, his voice softening. "I'm glad you got a date with this girl. But rumor is, she's high-class. You better get your act together before Thursday."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "What's that supposed to mean?" Evan asked, genuinely curious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "She wants a cool, sophisticated dude. If you want to get her something special, think Gucci purse, expensive shoes, jewelry\endash "}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 "That's it! You're a genius, dude," Evan interrupted, his face lighting up with inspiration.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Guido grinned, pleased with himself. "What are you gonna get her?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 They pulled into the gym parking lot, and as they headed toward the entrance, Evan replied, "I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92m not sure. I'll go to the mall tomorrow and look for inspiration."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 The two friends entered the gym, Guido's flashy appearance drawing rolled-eyes, and Evan's mind abuzz with possibilities. }
