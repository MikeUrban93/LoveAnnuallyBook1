Following the poignant events of the previous chapter, something within Sarah reverted her to her more rigid demeanor. It wasn't a conscious decision; we come to understand later in the chapter, perhaps even in this scene. It's revealed that Sarah's father had engaged a tutor who instilled in her the principles of finishing school, heavily emphasizing business etiquette. The emphasis was always on maintaining composure, perfect posture, and unwavering politeness. The tutor went as far as to teach Sarah six or seven different facial expressions to use based on the circumstances. The moment Sarah settled at the dinner table, years of ingrained training unconsciously steered her toward an analytical approach in such scenarios.
