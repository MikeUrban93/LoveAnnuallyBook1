If you have any thoughts one way or the other, please let me know. I've updated my outlines with the new chapters and scenes in red in the attached Word documents. In the larger Word documents, I highlighted the changes in red so they stand out.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 My notes were too large to fit in this chat, so I put all my notes in the file summary.docx. I also included updated outlines. However, you only have to look at those if you want to. All the updated information is in the summary file.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 If this requires too much work or is best discussed on a video call, I am open to scheduling and paying for a one-off session before our next meeting. If there's not much to say, that's fine. I will continue writing based on these changes and whatever else pops up in my mind, lol.}}
