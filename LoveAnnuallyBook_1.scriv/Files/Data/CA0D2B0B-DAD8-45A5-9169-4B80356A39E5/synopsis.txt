Sarah hadn't met Liz yet, but on the other side of her apartment door, she overheard Sarah making a comment about ugly Christmas sweaters. One of Liz's few guilty pleasures was playfully teasing her friends and family. She happened to be wearing an ugly Christmas sweater, which was her Christmas eve and Christmas tradition, one that Evan didn't share. She swung open the door before Sarah was about to knock and pretended to give Sarah the evil eye for comments about ugly Christmas sweaters. However, Sarah found out that this was just a playful way that the Vaughn family interacted with their loved ones. Liz quickly hugged Sarah and welcomed her into the family.
