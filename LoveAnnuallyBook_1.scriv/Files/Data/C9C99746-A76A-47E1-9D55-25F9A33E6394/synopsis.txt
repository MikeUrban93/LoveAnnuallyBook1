After settling into their room on Christmas Eve, Sarah felt an inexplicable shift in her environment. The fabrics she touched seemed softer than silk, the scents wafting through the air were almost heavenly, and colors around her appeared impossibly vivid. Strangely, her hearing seemed to be the only sense that was less acute, as if the clamor of the world had receded, leaving only its most cherished gifts for her to savor. The atmosphere, the presence of her family, and their unique expressions of love profoundly and mysteriously intensified her senses. As she lay in bed ready to drift into sleep, a tidal wave of emotion surged within her, so potent that it led to a first in Sarah's life: she found herself overwhelmed by the joyful release of tears she couldn't control.
