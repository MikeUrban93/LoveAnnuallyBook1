It was Christmas Eve, and Evan and Sarah were on a drive from Champaign, Illinois, to Glenview, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago. Even though school had gone on holiday break, Sarah's workload remained just as heavy. This was the peak of her philanthropic activities during the holiday season. Evan drove contentedly, looking forward to his 3-day Christmas visit with his sister. Meanwhile, Sarah worked in the car, feeling a sense of longing to stay behind and manage her responsibilities as an event coordinator.
