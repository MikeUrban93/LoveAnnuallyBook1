\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 **Scene 1:**}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan had been strategic, leading Sarah on a route that unavoidably passed the spot of their first kiss. He paused there, gazing at her with an intensity that made her heart thump against her ribs. "I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve been waiting to kiss you again since the first moment I saw you today,\u8221\'94 he confessed, his voice rough.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Gently, Evan's fingers curled around hers, the sensation setting a tremor of awareness coursing through her. "Come with me," he suggested, his voice as soft and alluring as the hold he had on her hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Sarah recoiled slightly, confusion flickering in her eyes. "What are you doing?" she asked, her tone wavering between uncertainty and curiosity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m holding your hand.\u8221\'94 His reply was casual, as though it were the most natural thing in the world. Anticipating her need for an explanation, he added, \u8220\'93I figured it was okay. Everything less than that is allowed once you\u8217\'92ve gone to a certain point with someone. Since we already kissed twice, holding hands seems a given.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Despite the knots of anxiety tying her stomach into pretzel-like twists, Sarah discovered she couldn't quite fight off the lure of Evan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s infectious confidence. His logic was faultless, and the thought occurred to her\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 }{\f1\fs28\i1\cf4 <$Scr_Cs::0>That does make sense!<!$Scr_Cs::0>}{\f0\fs28\b0\i0 \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 adding an almost humorous slant to her internal dilemma. As they meandered through the bustling food court, immersed in the vibrant chatter that encapsulated the university's social scene, she felt her hand comfortably nestle into his. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 The food court was a vibrant hub of activity. Students moved to and fro, their laughter and discussions creating an ambient hum that echoed around the vast space. The air was rich with the tantalizing scent of food from different cultures, and the murals that adorned the walls injected a youthful energy into the surroundings. Amid the chaos and noise, Sarah and Evan stood out, their hands interlocked in a silent promise of an unforeseen journey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 But with every passing minute, Sarah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s unease grew. The constant acknowledgement Evan received from the other students, the knowing looks, and the insinuating whispers from the predominantly female crowd were disconcerting. She wondered if she'd become an intruder in his world. She began to question why he had chosen her of all people. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 With an unexpected prompt from Evan, they found themselves seated at a table, the noise and activity of the food court reduced to a dull hum in the background. Evan returned shortly with bottles of water and fruit cups, a simple and light snack as per Sarah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s request.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 They began with the basics. An exchange of names, of basic introductions. But when Evan asked her to share something about herself, she found herself caught in an awkward limbo. Nervousness snuck up on her, strangling her words and turning her eloquent academic accomplishments into a frantic, tumble of phrases. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 As the minutes passed, Sarah could feel the weight of awkwardness settle over them. The thrill of their earlier encounter was rapidly giving way to her self-doubt and anxiety. When it became too much, Sarah fled. Her flight triggered by her own insecurities, fear, and uncertainty.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 **Scene 2:**}
\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan was quick on his feet. He chased after her, calling out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey, Cinderella, wait up, wait up!\u8221\'94 His voice echoed around her as he finally caught up.}
\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 She stopped abruptly, pivoting to face him. Her eyes were wide, her breaths quick. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you call me Cinderella?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because you\u8217\'92re always running away from me like it\u8217\'92s midnight.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 His words were a playful challenge, one that made her insides twist uncomfortably. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you keep pursuing me? It\u8217\'92s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 They both knew she had a point. Their worlds were vastly different, their paths almost impossible to align. But Evan persisted. He wanted to understand her, get to know her. But more importantly, he wanted her to see that he was not intimidated by her genius IQ, her different world. He wanted to step into her world, and he wanted her to step into his.}
\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 A tug of war ensued, their words, their feelings, and their attraction battling against their different worlds. Their conversation veered from Evan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s popularity among females to Sarah\u8217\'92s commitment to her education and career. Through it all, Evan maintained a relentless interest in Sarah, a spark of fascination that was impossible to ignore.}
\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 As their conversation progressed, Sarah found herself slowly crumbling under Evan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s onslaught of well-meaning persuasion. When Evan suggested that they try to find out why they were drawn to each other by going on a date, Sarah was left reeling, her defenses weakening.}
\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 His plea for her to enjoy the college life beyond academics was convincing. He posed questions that had her rethinking her carefully laid out plan. Evan had a way of disrupting her thoughts, her rigidity, and she found it both unsettling and invigorating. His kisses didn't help, sending her mind into a tizzy, clouding her usual sharp intelligence.}
\par\plain \f0\fs28\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Despite the whirlwind of feelings, Sarah agreed to go on a date with Evan. A small step, a minor concession, but a step nonetheless. They parted ways with a promise to meet for a date, their connection deepened by the sweet sting of their shared kisses.}
