\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs28\b0 Evan finds himself momentarily waiting in the lavish lobby of The Grandeur, a luxury hotel situated near O'Hare airport in Chicago, Illinois. Amidst the opulence, his phone vibrates with a text from Sarah, providing him directions to the grand ballroom where she is the lead event coordinator for a prestigious nonprofit organization. Following her guidance, Evan enters the room just as Sarah is immersed in her professional duties. Observing her for the first time in her element, he is struck by more than mere admiration. To describe his reaction as impressed would be a gross understatement; he's utterly captivated by her competence and grace.}{ }}
