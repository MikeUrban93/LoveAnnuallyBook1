Liz prepared a Christmas Eve feast for her husband, Joe, Evan, Sarah, and a surprise guest. While preparing dinner, Joe and Liz talk about what to expect. Evan had been referring to Sarah as "the one." Liz's anticipation was high, and she was excited to see her brother, whom she hadn't seen since summer, and meet the first girl he ever brought home with him for Christmas. That alone said a lot about his feelings for Sarah.
