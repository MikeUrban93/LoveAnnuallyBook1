\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Sarah's eyes sparkled as she caught the joke. Even though it was a playful jab at her, she found it endearing. His sense of humor put her at ease.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Sarah burst into laughter, shaking her head. "Ha ha, you're so funny! I promise, no more r\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u233\'E9sum\u233\'E9 recitations. Let's stick to the topics that are normally disclosed on a first date."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan raised his glass, his eyes sparkling. "Deal," he said, his voice tinged with genuine enthusiasm. "Let's make this a night to remember."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Sarah's heart gave a little leap, and a warm, pleasurable sensation spread through her. She was beginning to feel truly comfortable with him, and the night seemed full of promise. With a smile, she reached out and clinked her glass to his, toasting to the sentiment.}
