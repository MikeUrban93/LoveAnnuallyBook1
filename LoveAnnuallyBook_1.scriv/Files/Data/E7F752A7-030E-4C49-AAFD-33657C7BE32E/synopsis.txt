Liz and Joe made an excuse that they had plans in the morning after Christmas. They were evasive when questioned by Evan, but after Evan drove his mom to the airport, he was happy to have alone time with Sarah. Evan was a bit worried when it was almost time for him and Sarah to head back to college, and Liz and Joe hadn't returned yet. When they returned, they had a surprise for Evan and Sarah â€“ they eloped.
