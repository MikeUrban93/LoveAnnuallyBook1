As the magical and unforgettable Christmas Eve drew to a close, the family's final tradition of opening one gift per person had been fulfilled. Eager for a peaceful night's sleep before the bustling excitement of Christmas morning, Sarah and Evan prepared to retire to their room. Yet, Sarah had one last surprise for Evan up her sleeve. Handing her laptop and phone over to Liz, she asked her to stash them away securely and to resist any pleas from her to give them back until after Christmas was over. With this simple yet profound gesture, Sarah demonstrated her commitment to truly unplug and focus solely on their family Christmasâ€”a priceless gift that offered an immeasurable reward.
