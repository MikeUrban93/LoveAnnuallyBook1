Please rewrite the description of that location using the following information:}
\par\plain \f0\fs26\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 The undergrad library's lighting was always very bright\endash fluorescent. That made it feel less calm than your description. Also, there was always a group or two of students studying together, talking in regular voices rather than hushed tones. Finally, it was common for people to go to the library to flirt with their crushes. Not sure how you capture that, though.}}
