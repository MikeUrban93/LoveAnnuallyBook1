Evan gathered Guido, Patti, Roxanne, and friends to volunteer for cleaning debris in central Illinois following a tornado. Sarah took the helm as the lead event coordinator, working for the nonprofit organization "Home Is Where the Heart Is." Together, they turned a time of devastation into a period of community and healing, all working towards restoring the farmlands.
