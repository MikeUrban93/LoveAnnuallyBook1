            <Title>0115 Sarah is Frazzled</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah arrives at her class uncharacteristically five minutes late. The typically well-prepared, professional Sarah finds herself frazzled but turns it into a well-received class session.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The classroom was a microcosm of order and structure, juxtaposed with the youthful energy of the students filling it. As the wall clock ticked, the students' faces mirrored their confusion, their eyes flicking to the vacant podium, to the ticking clock, then back to the podium. Where was their punctual teacher's assistant, Sarah Wilkins? 
Then, the door swung open, and there she was, Sarah. Except she was different. Her usually neat hair was let down, her eyes were bare without the usual frame of glasses, and there was a flush to her cheeks that was never there before.
With a silent apology mirrored in her expression, she straightened her outfit, straightened herself, and stepped towards the podium. &quot;I apologize for being late. It will not happen again. Today we will review topics on next week’s exam,” she declared. Her voice, though steady, had an unfamiliar softness to it. 
While Sarah wrote on the board, a student raised his hand. &quot;Ms. Wilkins, we have never discussed that material,&quot; he pointed out. 
Sarah's eyes widened a tad, realization slowly dawning on her. There was a beat of silence before she let out a soft laugh, clearing her throat. “Did you ever have one of those days where something happens that you didn’t expect, and it throws you off your game?” she asked, leaning against her desk in a relaxed pose, the air around her lightening.
Nods and smiles of understanding echoed around the room. It was a rare glimpse of Sarah, the person, not just Sarah, their teacher's assistant.
“Today is one of those days for me,” she admitted, a touch of color staining her cheeks. “Let me tell you a secret about exams. 80% of the questions simply test your memorization. The other 20% are laced with trick questions to gauge how thoroughly you understand the material. Let's focus on the trick questions instead of wasting time on simple memorization. I think this will give everybody a better chance to ace this exam. Is everyone agreeable to that?”
The room erupted in unanimous approval. For once, excitement echoed through the room, as opposed to the usual resignation. The rest of the class flowed easily, a stark difference from their usual sessions. 
As the class emptied, one student, Katie Andrews, approached Sarah. “Ms. Wilkins, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed our class today. Whatever happened, I hope will happen again next week!” 
The corner of Sarah's lips twitched upwards, her heart swelling in her chest. With a nod and a warm smile, she looked at Katie, her thoughts echoing Katie's sentiments. Me too.

            <Title>0125 Evan Finds Sarah at the library</Title>
            <Synopsis>For a second time, Evan returns to the scene of the kiss, looking for Sarah. He decides to look in the library, where he finds Sarah.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah settled back into her regular spot at the undergrad library, the weight of her studies pressing on her mind. She made yet another effort to immerse herself in her work. The pages of her book offered a brief escape, but a familiar sensation made her skin tingle. The very air around her seemed to shift.
Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted him: the mystery man she’d shared that unexpected kiss with. Their eyes met, and a mix of anxiety and excitement surged within her. She tried to hide behind her book, but her attempt was feeble at best. 
His presence drew nearer until she could no longer pretend not to notice. She took a deep breath and peeked at him from behind her book. Those eyes, so intense and yet playful, met hers. The world seemed to pause for a split second.
He held out a pair of glasses—the ones she thought she’d never see again. They were fixed. As she nodded her permission, her heart raced, and she closed her eyes, feeling the gentle touch of his fingers as he replaced her glasses with the repaired pair. She could feel the warmth of his hands, even though they barely brushed against her skin.
His voice broke the silence. “Ah, much better. Not that there’s anything wrong with the glasses you were wearing, but I like these a lot better. I hope I did a good job fixing them?”
Trying to maintain her composure, she replied, “Yes, you did. Thank you. How much do I owe you?”
“You don’t owe me anything! But you can join me for a snack at the food court. We could call it an energy exchange?” he countered, his tone playful.
Sarah hesitated, torn between her responsibilities and the undeniable pull she felt towards him. “I have studying to do.”
“Well, I have to study too!” Evan declared. 
His persistence was both vexing and endearing. When he vanished momentarily only to return to the seat across from her and read a book upside down, she couldn’t help but be amused. 
“Do you always read your books upside down?” Sarah queried, her eyebrow hitched up in amusement.
With an exaggerated gasp, Evan flipped the book, a playful grin dancing on his lips. “Ah, now this book makes more sense!”
Chuckles bubbled up from Sarah’s throat as she glimpsed the title, Female Poets of the 19th Century. “Really? You don’t look like a poetry major to me.”
With a swift nod and a spark in his eyes, Evan replied, “I love the female poets of the 19th century.”
Arching her brow in a silent challenge, Sarah shot back, “Can you even name one?”
Not missing a beat, Evan exclaimed, “Emily Dickinson!”
A smirk curled Sarah’s lips as she teased, “Do you really know that, or is she the only female poet you’ve heard of?”
Evan leaned back, a chuckle escaping him. “I am an expert on female poetry from the 19th century!”
A soft laugh from Sarah echoed around them. “You are, are you? Okay then, what is your favorite poem?” 
Before he could glance down at his safety net, Sarah commanded, “Close the book. Okay, now tell me your favorite poem.”
A whimsical story spilled from Evan’s lips, an almost poetic cadence to his voice. “Well, I can’t remember who wrote it, but I remember the name. It’s called The Kiss. It’s a poem about this beautiful coed saved from certain death by a valiant young man. They have this most amazing kiss. But then she disappears like Cinderella. He ultimately finds her, and she futilely attempts to resist his charming ways.”
An intrigued smile formed on Sarah’s face. “Hmm, interesting. So how does the poem end?” 
Evan replied with a confident air, “Happily ever after, of course!”
Evan’s charm weakened her resolve as she attempted to refocus on her study material. His antics continued. He opened the book again and altered his facial expression and voice to mimic a distinguished professor.
He pretended to critique a poem. “Very nice. Excellent poetic structure. Great use of hyperbole.”
She couldn’t suppress her laughter. His comic faux critique of a poem was the last straw. “You are going to keep annoying me until I agree to go to the food court, aren’t you?”
Evan countered, his eyes wide in mock surprise, “Annoying? I was shooting for charming!”
Sarah surrendered to a full-blown laugh. “Okay, fine, annoyingly charming.”
They bantered back and forth. His sincerity shone through when he said, “I’ll stop bothering you if you want. But I say let’s get to know each other. Unless I imagined it, that kiss was wonderful for you, too. All I’m asking for is fifteen minutes. That’s it, just fifteen minutes of your time! What do you say?”
She sighed, admitting defeat—not to him, but to the chemistry between them. “Alright, fifteen minutes it is!” 
As she gathered her things, he gracefully gestured for her to lead the way. He reached the door first, holding it open for her with a kind smile, cementing in her mind that this mystery man was indeed a true gentleman</Text>

            <Synopsis>Evan sees Sarah, a woman he has never met, headed for disaster in the form of concrete steps. He rushes to save her from a dangerous fall, and in the process, they share a kiss.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah bolted from the library, earbuds blaring, eyes wide with the impending doom of lateness. The library steps loomed ahead, a sudden drop just waiting for the unwary, and she was just the kind of unwary the steps had in mind.
From the corner of her eye, she noticed Evan. He was just another student, someone she hadn't met before. But he had spotted her imminent tumble, her focus diverted to the chaotic thoughts swirling in her mind.
“Hey, lady in the skirt suit!&quot; he shouted, loud enough for everyone to hear, but not the intended recipient. His voice echoed around them, the words floating above the heads of chuckling onlookers.
His legs propelled him forward, closing the gap between them with an urgency that matched her own. His arms enveloped her just as her foot missed the first step, the momentum of her hurried escape carrying them in a wild twirl. Her briefcase and purse took flight, flinging their contents everywhere. Her glasses escaped from her face, spiraling to the ground.
Her hair fell in a cascade of wavy blonde hair as the barrette that held it surrendered to the force of their twirl. As she leaned back into him, almost parallel to the ground, Evan could see that she was not a professor as he had initially thought, but a student like himself.
Their eyes locked, a silent conversation passing between them. &quot;I feel like I should kiss you,&quot; Evan said, his words floating in the space between them. Sarah's eyes sparkled with a mix of amusement and surprise, and she responded, &quot;I’m not going to stop you.&quot;
Their lips met in a passionate kiss that seemed to suspend time, making the world outside their embrace fade away. After the kiss, Evan helped her to her feet, a newfound softness in his gaze.
Suddenly, reality came rushing back to her, and she remembered her lateness. She quickly gathered her scattered belongings with Evan's help. 
&quot;What's your name?&quot; he asked. 
Flustered, she replied, &quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot;
&quot;That's a strange name,&quot; he joked, but the humor was lost on her. She was too caught up in her rush, her mind a whirlwind of confusion.
She dashed away, unknowingly leaving her broken glasses behind. Evan picked them up and called after her, but she was already disappearing into the distance. Evan was left standing there, a lighthearted grin on his face and her glasses in his hand, looking forward to the future encounter that their unexpected meeting promised.

            <Title>Nicholas Sparks</Title>
            <Text>Set amidst the beautiful backdrop of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the narrative introduces Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, two distinct souls on the verge of destiny. As their senior year begins, life proceeds as it always has. They are strangers, moving in different circles, unaware that fate will soon interweave their stories.
Evan, blessed with striking good looks and a compelling aura, is the center of attention on campus. Yet, his popularity doesn’t stem from vanity, but rather a genuine, likable personality that effortlessly attracts others, a quality cultivated by his kind-hearted sister, Liz. His academic prowess, however, doesn’t quite match his social skills. Not due to a lack of capability, but a preference for the liberating outdoors over confined classrooms. Despite this, he is committed to achieving a 3.0 GPA, a promise made to Liz that he intends to keep. Thus, he reluctantly trades time spent in nature for studying, hoping to uphold his promise.
Sarah, conversely, embodies academic excellence. A prospective business major and the heart of the university library, she is determined to graduate top of her class. Lost in an audio seminar one day, she abruptly realizes she is about to be late for a class she teaches. In her hurry to exit the library, she remains oblivious to the descending staircase just outside the door.
Noticing Sarah’s impending fall, Evan leaps into action. His warnings go unheard due to her earbuds, leaving him no choice but to dart toward her, intercepting her just in time. The ensuing spontaneous kiss shared in the aftermath of this dramatic event leaves an indelible mark on their hearts, igniting a flame they never knew existed.
Despite this unexpected turn of events, Sarah struggles to balance her newfound emotions with her ambitious plans to succeed her father in their family business. Having made a promise to both herself and her father to steer clear of romantic distractions until after her graduation, she finds herself in a predicament.
Even so, Evan's charm and the chemistry between them proves too strong to resist. When he returns her forgotten glasses, Sarah finally succumbs to his persistence, agreeing to a date. Their relationship blossoms, albeit with Sarah setting clear expectations to ensure her academic aspirations remain undeterred. Evan, captivated by Sarah, readily agrees to these conditions.
Their shared senior year becomes a transformative journey. Sarah discovers a new side of her personality as she learns to navigate social engagements, while Evan, with Sarah's guidance, sees a marked improvement in his academics. But as graduation nears, uncertainty begins to cloud Sarah's mind.
Unknown to Sarah, Evan is planning a proposal. During their graduation party, in the presence of their friends and a surprise appearance from her parents, Evan proposes. Caught off guard, Sarah accepts, much to her parents' surprise as she had previously downplayed the intensity of their relationship.
Her father, a man of rationality and fairness, offers her a choice - to pursue a future with Evan in Chicago without his financial support, or to stick to her initial plan of achieving her Masters and joining him in Seattle. Faced with this dilemma, Sarah must decide between her long-standing ambitions and her heart's yearning for Evan.
In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, this tale of love and self-discovery explores the poignant moments of life-changing decisions. Despite the odds, it is Sarah's heart that prevails, choosing a future with Evan in Chicago over her original academic plan. This is a testament to the power of love and its ability to reshape lives, a familiar theme in Sparks' emotional narratives.</Text>

            <Title>0164 Evan Gives Sarah a Pendant</Title>
            <Synopsis>After dinner, Evan gives Sarah a customized, inexpensive pendant before leaving in her car. The pendant is more of a sentimental piece of jewelry meant to commemorate the unique way statement. Although Sarah is accustomed to wearing expensive jewelry, she loves the pendant Evan had made for her.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The cool early fall night embraced them as they stepped out of the Thai Garden Restaurant, their hearts still fluttering from the enchanting evening they had shared. Hand in hand, Evan guided Sarah towards her car, the silent connection between them saying more than words ever could. Each step they took was filled with the lingering excitement of their first date, and neither of them felt the need to break the silence.
Once they reached Sarah's car, she turned around and leaned against the driver's side door, facing Evan. He looked into her eyes, the depths of his gaze reflecting the whirlwind of emotions he felt in that moment. The air was charged with an electrifying blend of desire and sentiment.
Evan leaned in, his lips finding hers in a kiss that was both familiar and new. The kiss started tenderly, an exploration of their feelings before it deepened into a passionate embrace. It was a moment of surrender, a release of the tension that had been building throughout the evening. The energy between them shifted dramatically, the formality of their earlier conversation giving way to the raw intensity of their emotions.
As their lips finally parted, Sarah looked into Evan's eyes, her heart racing. She spoke, her voice a mixture of vulnerability and honesty. &quot;I love the way I feel when you kiss me, but it scares me. You have this power over me. It’s intoxicating. I apologize for my business-like approach. I’ve never had a real romantic relationship before, and I’m struggling with the fear of losing control.&quot;
Evan's gaze held hers, his expression soft and understanding. &quot;Never apologize for being who you are. You have the same power over me. It doesn’t scare me, though. It feels like I have been waiting for you. I’ve never felt this way about anybody before. I understand this is unfamiliar territory for you. I promise I won’t pressure you to do anything before you’re ready.&quot;
A playful smile crossed Sarah's lips. &quot;I sense you won’t have to wait too long.&quot;
Evan's eyes lit up with hope. &quot;I like the sound of that! I don’t suppose you have time to hang out more tonight?&quot;
Sarah shook her head, a hint of regret in her expression. &quot;Not tonight. My friend Katie is waiting for me back at my apartment. I will be there on Sunday to see your game.&quot;
Seeing Sarah's commitment to attending his game brought a genuine smile to Evan's face. &quot;I'm looking forward to it.&quot;
Evan's next words took Sarah by surprise as he pulled out a box from his pocket. Inside the box lay a delicate silver pendant attached to a silver chain. The pendant was a tiny set of eyeglasses, a symbol that held a deep significance for both of them.
&quot;May I put this on you, my Cinderella?&quot; Evan's voice held a touch of playfulness, and Sarah turned around to allow him to fasten the necklace around her neck. As she turned back to face him, she held the pendant in her hand, examining it closely.
Evan could see the curiosity and confusion in Sarah's eyes, prompting him to share the story behind the necklace. &quot;You know how I call you my Cinderella because you’re always running away from me?&quot;
Sarah nodded, her lips curling into a fond smile.
Evan continued, his voice gentle and sentimental. &quot;I wanted to get you something for our date tonight, and I wanted it to be unique. While shopping, I ran across this glass case with a bunch of small Cinderella-type glass slippers and shoes. It turns out people collect these things. They gave me the idea of a necklace with an eyeglass pendant inspired by the glasses you left behind while making your escape.&quot;
Sarah's smile deepened, and she chuckled softly at Evan's playful comment.
&quot;I couldn’t find any necklaces like that,&quot; Evan continued, his voice filled with warmth. &quot;I shopped at all the jewelry stores I could find. But I couldn’t find anything that would work. I even tried the jewelry sections at the department stores, nothing. I was about to give up when I passed by this antique store. And what do you know, the universe plopped an antique doll with the perfect size glasses right in the window for me to see.&quot;
Evan's voice carried a mix of amazement and excitement as he recounted his journey to find the pendant. &quot;I bought the doll and took the glasses to a jeweler to have the glasses attached to a chain. The jeweler suggested dipping it in silver so that it would last forever. Forever sounded good to me, so I had him do that. I meant it to commemorate our first kiss. Whenever you wear it, I want you to remember that magical moment.&quot;
Tears welled up in Sarah's eyes, her heart deeply touched by Evan's thoughtful gesture. She looked at the pendant, now hanging around her neck, and felt a rush of emotions she hadn't anticipated.
&quot;Thank you, Evan,&quot; she managed to say, her voice filled with genuine gratitude. &quot;That’s so romantic and so sweet. I can’t believe I’m crying. I haven’t cried since I was a child.&quot;
Evan pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her in a comforting hug. &quot;Does that mean you like it?&quot;
Sarah looked up at him, her eyes glistening with tears. &quot;I love it! It’s the most wonderful, beautiful, stupendous gift I’ve ever received from anybody. I can’t believe I’m going to ask this, but if you kept the doll, may I have it?&quot;
Evan chuckled softly, his fingers brushing away the tears that had escaped down her cheeks. &quot;I will bring it on Sunday.&quot;
Sarah's smile was radiant as she expressed her gratitude once again. The desire to have the doll surprised even her, but in that moment, she knew it held a special place in her heart.
As the night drew to a close, Sarah's sense of reluctance mingled with the excitement of what lay ahead. &quot;I don’t want this night to end, but I need to get home. My friend is waiting, and I have an early class tomorrow.&quot;
Evan nodded, his gaze holding hers. &quot;No worries. Can I ask you for one more thing, maybe two?&quot;
A playful glint danced in Sarah's eyes. &quot;You sure can.&quot;
Evan's voice was light, filled with a touch of humor. &quot;Can I get your last name? Maybe a phone number or an email?&quot; He smirked, a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.
Sarah burst into laughter, her eyes sparkling with amusement. &quot;Of course, you can.&quot; She handed him a business card, encouraging him to send his information to her.
Before they parted ways, they shared one more long, passionate kiss, a sweet promise of what was to come. As they finally pulled away, the echo of their shared emotions lingered in the cool night air, a silent promise of the journey their hearts were embarking upon.

            <Synopsis>Evan convinces Sarah to break from her studies and join him at the food court for a snack. Panicked, she runs out on Evan, but he catches up to her outside.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan had been strategic, leading Sarah on a route that unavoidably passed the spot of their first kiss. He paused there, gazing at her with an intensity that made her heart thump against her ribs. &quot;I’ve been waiting to kiss you again since the first moment I saw you today,” he confessed, his voice rough.
Gently, Evan's fingers curled around hers, the sensation setting a tremor of awareness coursing through her. &quot;Come with me,&quot; he suggested, his voice as soft and alluring as the hold he had on her hand.
Sarah recoiled slightly, confusion flickering in her eyes. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked, her tone wavering between uncertainty and curiosity.
“I’m holding your hand.” His reply was casual, as though it were the most natural thing in the world. Anticipating her need for an explanation, he added, “I figured it was okay. Everything less than that is allowed once you’ve gone to a certain point with someone. Since we already kissed twice, holding hands seems a given.”
Despite the knots of anxiety tying her stomach into pretzel-like twists, Sarah discovered she couldn't quite fight off the lure of Evan’s infectious confidence. His logic was faultless, and the thought occurred to her—That does make sense!—adding an almost humorous slant to her internal dilemma. As they meandered through the bustling food court, immersed in the vibrant chatter that encapsulated the university's social scene, she felt her hand comfortably nestle into his. 
The food court was a vibrant hub of activity. Students moved to and fro, their laughter and discussions creating an ambient hum that echoed around the vast space. The air was rich with the tantalizing scent of food from different cultures, and the murals that adorned the walls injected a youthful energy into the surroundings. Amid the chaos and noise, Sarah and Evan stood out, their hands interlocked in a silent promise of an unforeseen journey.
But with every passing minute, Sarah’s unease grew. Everywhere they went, students gave Evan friendly nods, simple smiles, or a casual wave of the wrist. The knowing looks and insinuating whispers from the predominantly female crowd were disconcerting. She wondered if she'd become an intruder in his world. She began to question why he had chosen her of all people.
Prompted by Evan, they found themselves seated at a table, the noise and activity of the food court reduced to a dull hum in the background. Evan returned shortly with bottles of water and fruit cups, a simple and light snack as per Sarah’s request.
The exchange began with the basics: their names and simple introductions. But when Evan asked her to share something more about herself, a wave of awkwardness washed over Sarah. She was so accustomed to the structure of professional-like interactions, the conversational ebb and flow of academic dialogues, that this request for personal detail felt foreign, disarming.
Unconsciously, she slipped into autopilot mode. The socially naive part of her receded, replaced by the poised, articulate woman who had faced countless academic panels and college recruitment interviews. With the clinical precision of a resume, she began to list her accomplishments, her words spilling out in an educated, polished tumble of phrases that felt jarringly out of place in the casual environment.
Across the table, Evan watched her, his eyes sparkling with a quiet warmth. He saw her struggle, her resort to what was comfortable and familiar. Instead of interrupting or correcting her, he chose to sit back, a gentle smile playing on his lips. He was attentive, listening to each word with interest, and his expression was one of sheer fascination. There was an undeniable charm in her earnest recital, in the passionate way she recounted her academic accomplishments, in her slight discomfort navigating the unfamiliar waters of personal conversation. In the subtle crinkle of his eyes, the softening of his gaze, anyone looking would see the deepening of Evan’s affection for Sarah, an adoration unphased by her unconventional response.
The silence that hung between them after Sarah finished speaking was palpable, carrying the weight of her misstep. But within Evan's patient gaze, there was no judgment—only an eagerness to know more, to delve deeper into the complex enigma that was Sarah.
As the minutes passed, Sarah could feel the weight of awkwardness settle over them. The thrill of their earlier encounter was rapidly giving way to her self-doubt and anxiety. Overwhelmed, Sarah fled the food court, her flight triggered by her own insecurities, fear, and uncertainty</Text>

            <Synopsis>Sarah's resistance weakens further as she agrees to go on a date with Evan later in the week.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan's foot tapped impatiently against the floor as he glanced at the clock. They were late for work, and Guido was taking forever in the bathroom, primping and preening as if it were a special occasion. Evan's anxiety level was ratcheting up; he needed to be at the gym by six o'clock for a client session, and time was slipping away. But more than that, he was desperate to share his news with Guido, his best friend.
&quot;Come on, Guido!&quot; Evan called out, knowing that his plea would probably go ignored. Guido's fixation with his appearance was well-known, especially now that there was a new female personal trainer at the gym he wanted to impress.
Finally, Guido emerged from the bathroom, every strand of his hair gelled perfectly into place. &quot;Relax, bro,&quot; he said, a grin spreading across his face. &quot;We've got plenty of time.&quot;
&quot;You've got plenty of time,&quot; Evan corrected, grabbing his keys. &quot;I've got a client session at six, and I need to talk to you about Sarah.&quot;
Guido's eyes widened. &quot;Sarah? What's the big news, bro?&quot;
&quot;Not here,&quot; Evan said, urging Guido towards the door. &quot;In the car.&quot;
Guido's old Honda Civic roared to life, and as they pulled out of the apartment complex, Evan began to relive his experience with Sarah, detailing every moment of their time together. Guido listened, a bemused expression on his face, concern growing as he realized how infatuated Evan was with this girl.
&quot;Dude, you're obsessed,&quot; Guido finally interrupted. &quot;I've never seen you like this.&quot;
Evan's face flushed. &quot;I need your help, Guido. How can I make the date special? What should I get her?&quot;
Guido looked at Evan like he'd lost his mind. &quot;How would I know what's special? Special to me is spending the night.&quot; He rattled off a list of common gifts: candy, flowers, wine, and lingerie.
Evan shot down each suggestion, claiming they were either cliché or inappropriate for a first date. Guido's patience wore thin, irritation creeping into his voice. &quot;I don't know, dude, you're asking the wrong guy. Get your act together, or she's gonna ditch you ten minutes into the date. You better play cool like 'The Guido.'&quot;
Evan's face fell, but he knew Guido had a point. He was acting overly enthusiastic, and he needed to reel it in.
&quot;Look, bro,&quot; Guido continued, his voice softening. &quot;I'm glad you got a date with this girl. But rumor is, she's high-class. You better get your act together before Thursday.&quot;
&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot; Evan asked, genuinely curious.
&quot;She wants a cool, sophisticated dude. If you want to get her something special, think Gucci purse, expensive shoes, jewelry–&quot;
&quot;That's it! You're a genius, dude,&quot; Evan interrupted, his face lighting up with inspiration.
Guido grinned, pleased with himself. &quot;What are you gonna get her?&quot;
They pulled into the gym parking lot, and as they headed toward the entrance, Evan replied, &quot;I’m not sure. I'll go to the mall tomorrow and look for inspiration.&quot;
The two friends entered the gym, Guido's flashy appearance drawing rolled-eyes, and Evan's mind abuzz with possibilities.

            <Title>Undergrad Library</Title>
            <Text>Name of the place: Undergrad Library, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
Nickname: Undergrad Library. For this novel never use the acronym UGL.
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign/Urbana
Type of place: Library
What role does this setting play in the story? 
Two scenes take place at this location. At the beginning of the story, this is where Sarah was when she realizes she was late for the class she was supposed to teach in her role as a teacher's assistant.
It plays a vital role because this is where Evan is headed to study extra to maintain a 3.0 GPA. He is on his way to the library, and she is rushing out. Shortly after she leaves the library, Evan saves her from a severe fall, and they kiss.
The second scene at this location is when Evan desperately wants to see the girl he kissed but has little information about. He gets the idea to check inside the library since that's where she came from on the day of the kiss. He finds her there and charms a reluctant Sarah into joining him at the food court.
Are there any unique or notable aspects of the setting? 
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's Undergraduate Library (UGL) is built underground due to a local ordinance at the time of its construction, in the late 1960s. This regulation stipulated that no structure could be erected that would cast a shadow on the Morrow Plots, an important agricultural research field located on campus.
The Morrow Plots were established in 1876 and are the oldest such experimental fields in the United States and the third oldest in the world. They have been used to develop new and improved methods of farming and to study the long-term impacts of various farming techniques on soil composition and crop yields.
To respect this historical site and adhere to the ordinance, the university decided to construct the Undergraduate Library underground, which allowed it to provide a large, modern library facility without casting a shadow on the Morrow Plots.
The UGL was specifically designed to cater to the needs of undergraduate students, with a wide array of resources and study spaces, and it quickly became a hub for student learning and collaboration. Its subterranean construction adds a unique touch to its importance as an academic institution
Notes: 
The undergraduate library was a flurry of activity and bright, relentless fluorescent lighting. Instead of a quiet sanctuary, it was a hub of engagement, a hive buzzing with the energy of youthful minds. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a stark, almost clinical glow over the rows of tables and chairs, making the room feel less like a typical library and more like a vibrant community center.
Groups of students huddled together at the tables, doing their best to keep their voices down but often failing in those efforts, as evidenced by scolded looks from others trying to study.
In corners and along the aisles between bookshelves, there were pockets of flirtation. Amidst the academic pursuit, the library also served as a social arena, a meeting point for like-minded individuals who could connect over shared study materials and the occasional whispered joke. A glance stolen across the study table, a shy smile in response to a witty remark, the quiet exchange of notes – these were as common in the library as textbooks and highlighters.
It was more than a library; it was a microcosm of college life, a blend of hard work, cooperation, and the undercurrent of budding romance. Students came for the books but stayed for the energy and camaraderie that hummed through the bright, lively room.
</Text>
            <Notes>You have previously given me a description of what the undergrad library environment would've been like. Please rewrite the description of that location using the following information:

The undergrad library's lighting was always very bright–fluorescent. That made it feel less calm than your description. Also, there was always a group or two of students studying together, talking in regular voices rather than hushed tones. Finally, it was common for people to go to the library to flirt with their crushes. Not sure how you capture that, though.</Notes>

            <Title>Suzanne Collins</Title>
            <Text>For Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, senior year at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign began as an ordinary semester, the two strangers running in distinct circles. 
Evan, known for his athletic prowess and magnetic personality, drew attention without effort, though never letting it cloud his judgement. Raised by his compassionate sister, Liz, Evan treated all with kindness, be it a football star or a shy water boy. However, the academia was never his strongest suit, not due to lack of intellect, but his love for the open air and disdain for classroom boundaries. Nonetheless, he had a promise to Liz: to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA. So he traded the thrill of Frisbee games for quietude in the library, much to his friend Guido's disappointment. 
In contrast, Sarah was a powerhouse student, her sights set on graduating top of her class. The library was her sanctuary, the site of countless hours spent on her audio seminars and preparation for the Business-101 class she taught. Her life was a race against the clock, meticulously planned, her only companion her relentless ambition. The daughter of a tycoon, she was destined to be the future CEO of her father's company. She believed in a life devoid of romantic involvements until her Masters' degree was in hand. 
As fate would have it, their paths crossed when Sarah, engrossed in her seminar, nearly tripped down a set of stairs. Evan, sensing danger, sprinted to her aid, saving her in a sweeping embrace that culminated in an unexpected, passionate kiss. After the startling interaction, Sarah fled the scene, leaving behind only her glasses.
Days later, Evan located Sarah and returned her glasses, now repaired. Despite her attempts to remain focused, Sarah found herself capitulating to his charm, agreeing to join him for a break in the food court. Confronted with his popularity and the stark contrast between their lives, Sarah fled again, only to be pursued by Evan. They shared another electrifying kiss and agreed on a date. 
In preparation, Sarah turned to Katie Andrews, a bright student from her class, who, along with her hairstylist friend, assisted in updating Sarah's appearance and fashion. While getting a makeover, Sarah found herself reconsidering her stringent policy against romantic engagements. If she were to venture into this territory, she decided, it would be under calculated terms, safeguarding her academic aspirations. 
Evan agreed to her rules, love-struck since their first interaction. Their relationship flourished, with Sarah embracing her dormant romantic side and Evan improving academically with Sarah's help. As they savored the present, they remained silent about their future, Sarah wavering over her decision to attend an Ivy League school, and Evan planning a surprise proposal at their graduation party. 
At the party, Evan's proposal shocked Sarah. All her rationality screamed 'no', but she found herself saying 'yes', too consumed by love to refuse. The consequence was a potentially disapproving encounter with her father, who she had deceived about the intensity of her relationship with Evan. 
Her father presented two options: follow Evan to Chicago and begin a life with him while continuing her Masters, or stick to her initial plan. He would not force her to end her engagement, but if she chose Evan over the family business, his financial support would cease. 
Sarah found herself torn. She knew Evan's commitment to his sister and his promising job opportunity in Chicago, and she felt guilty about asking him to wait for her. The choice was clear, yet difficult: follow her meticulously planned path or surrender to the unpredictable allure of love. Ultimately, against all odds, Sarah chose Evan, her heart triumphing over logic.</Text>

            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0125 Evan Finds Sarah at the library
Characters: Evan, Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Time of Day: Morning
Locations: Undergrad Library
Tone: Sweet, cute, charming, playful
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
Although the weather is not apparent from underground, Evan just entered from outside and knew it was a perfect day. Feel free to have Evan use this information to persuade Sarah to take a break on a beautiful day and walk with him to the food court.
This is meant to be a high-energy, fun, and playful scene. After not seeing each other since the day of their kiss, the chemistry between them upon their second meeting is palpable.
While Sarah is still reluctant and somewhat resistant, Evan is all in. In this scene, we can see how Evan's charm and persistence will eventually shatter her resistance.
This is the third scene at this location, so we don't need to be overly descriptive of the setting—just small descriptions of their surroundings as required in the scene. 
Please make sure to include the dialogue and actions from scene elements 27 through 30 verbatim in all versions of this scene.
It's important to note that he still does not know Sarah's name, nor does she know his until the next scene.
Sequence of Events:
The scene begins with Evan walking into the library, his eyes scanning panoramically, seeking Sarah.
Evan was confident that close up, he could identify her. But he wasn’t sure he would recognize her from a distance. This became a moot point since only one student in the library was dressed in a business suit and wore her hair in a bun. There was no mistake he had found his mystery girl.
Sarah spotted Evan just as he headed toward her, and she slumped in her seat and pulled her book over her face, unsuccessfully trying to hide.
Evan approached Sarah. He smiled and waited patiently as her eyes peeked up at him from behind the book she was pretending to read. She lowered the book and sat up in her chair.
Evan held out the glasses that he had fixed and asked, “May I?” Sarah’s heart beat fast as she nodded.
 Her breathing increased, and her eyes closed as his hands moved toward her face. He carefully removed her glasses and replaced them with the glasses he repaired.
Following is a draft of the dialogue. The goal is to show Evan being cute and charming and Sarah finding him too charming to resist. And against her better judgment breaking from her study to go to the food court with him and get to know each other better.
Evan: “Ah, much better. Not that there’s anything wrong with the glasses you were wearing, but I like these a lot better. I hope I did a good job fixing them?”
Sarah: “Yes, you did. Thank you. How much do I owe you?”
Evan: “You don’t owe me anything! But you can join me for a snack at the food court. We could call it an energy exchange?”
Sarah was struggling to resist her desire to go with Evan.“I have studying to do.”
Evan: “You can’t take a half-hour break?”
Sarah: “No, I have a lot to study.”
Evan: “Well, I have to study too!”
Evan disappeared between two bookshelves. He returned to the table, sat across from Sarah, and intentionally read his book upside down.
Sarah: “Do you always read your books upside down?”
Evan turned the book right side up. “Ah, now this book makes more sense!”
Sarah laughed after reading the title, Female Poets of the 19th Century. “Really? You don’t look like a poetry major to me.”
Evan: “I love the female poets of the 19th century.”
Sarah: “Can you even name one?”
Evan: “Emily Dickinson!”
Sarah: “Do you know that, or is she the only female poet you’ve heard of?”
“I am an expert on female poetry from the 19th century!” joked Evan.
Sarah laughed. “You are, are you? Okay then, what is your favorite poem?” 
Evan looked down at the book. Sarah interrupted him.
“Close the book. Okay, now tell me your favorite poem.” 
He spun his whimsical tale. 
Evan: “Well, I can’t remember who wrote it, but I remember the name. It’s called The Kiss. It’s a poem about this beautiful coed saved from certain death by a valiant young man. They have this most amazing kiss. But then she disappears like Cinderella. He ultimately finds her, and she futilely attempts to resist his charming ways.”
Sarah smiled. “Hmm, interesting. So how does the poem end?” 
Evan: “Happily ever after, of course!”
Evan’s charm weakened her resolve as she attempted to refocus on her study material. Evan opened the book again and altered his facial expression and voice to mimic a distinguished professor.
He pretended to critique a poem.“Very nice. Excellent poetic structure. Great use of hyperbole.”
Sarah giggled. “You are going to keep annoying me until I agree to go to the food court, aren’t you?”
Evan: “Annoying? I was shooting for charming!”
Sarah laughed. “Okay, fine, annoyingly charming.”
Evan’s tone turned a bit more serious. “I’ll stop bothering you if you want. But I say let’s get to know each other. Unless I imagined it, that kiss was wonderful for you, too. All I’m asking for is 15 minutes. That’s it, just 15 minutes of your time! What do you say?”
Sarah relented and silently packed up her stuff.
“Is that a yes?” he asked.
 Sarah: “Yes, it is!” 
Sarah gathered up her stuff. Evan asked very gentlemanly as he motioned her to walk in front of him, and when they got to the door, he opened it for her. The scene will end at this point. The reader should be left feeling good about what happened and great anticipation for what comes next. Chemistry and romance are in the air.</Text>

            <Text>In the bustling arena of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, two seniors whose paths never crossed, found themselves entangled in a saga that was far from ordinary. 
Evan Vaughn was not just another handsome face on campus. He was the alluring, athletic gentleman whose popularity was magnified by his humility and kindness. A man molded by his saintly sister Liz, Evan didn't let his charm overshadow his true self. Yet, his intellectual potential was hidden beneath his love for the outdoors and a promise he made to Liz, to graduate with a respectable 3.0 GPA.
Sarah Wilkins, unlike Evan, was the embodiment of academic brilliance. Destined to sit atop her class, she found solace in the sterile confines of the university library, consumed by her dedication to excel. As a business major, her promise to her father and herself was simple yet stringent: No romantic distractions until she ascended to the helm of her father's multimillion-dollar corporation.
The monotony of their separate lives was disrupted when Evan, playing the reluctant hero, saved Sarah from a near-disastrous fall on campus. In a twist fit for a Patterson novel, their heated encounter ended in a passionate kiss, leaving Sarah to battle the inner turmoil of emotions she was unprepared for.
In the aftermath, Evan finds Sarah again, returns her misplaced glasses, and relentlessly attempts to break the shell of her self-imposed solitude. Succumbing to Evan's charm, Sarah eventually agrees to date him, but not without laying down a series of strict rules, a reflection of her business-like approach to life.
Their relationship, though thriving on passion, was not devoid of complications. The unforeseen turn of events at their graduation party was a testament to this. Evan's surprise proposal in front of an unsuspecting audience, including Sarah's parents, rocked the very foundation of Sarah's meticulously planned future.
As Sarah grappled with the aftermath of the proposal, her father, a stoic yet fair man, presented her with an ultimatum: Follow her original plan and join him in Seattle after obtaining her Master's, or carve a new path with Evan in Chicago at the expense of her father's financial support.
In classic James Patterson style, this tale crescendos with Sarah's monumental decision. Facing the crossroads between her longstanding plan and the life she never imagined, she defies the odds, choosing Evan and her heart, thus beginning a thrilling journey into an unknown future.</Text>

Scene Name: 0137 Evan Has a Special Gift Made
Characters: Guido, Jewelry Store Owner
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Location: A Local Mall
Tone: Anxious, excited, anticipatory, intense/focused
Weather: Not relevant for this scene
Special Instructions: 
In the sequence of events section, I provide some ideas of what might be done and spoken. You have full discretion to write this scene the way you feel works best.
Summary:
Evan headed to the mall to look for a special piece of jewelry that he could buy as a gift given to Sarah on their first date. He didn’t know what he was looking for, but he felt confident that he will find something special. 
He went from jewelry store to jewelry store and jewelry department to jewelry department of chain stores – without any luck. Just about to give up, he came upon a small privately owned jewelry store located in a somewhat hidden corner of the mall.
He saw something interesting he had never seen before. It was  a display case with tiny glass slippers– averaging about 3 to 4 inches in width.
He walked in and talked to the owner about the glass slippers. The jewelry store owner explained that people collect these tiny glass slippers and put them in a curio cabinet at home or on display somewhere. They are simply ornamental knickknacks.
The reason that the glass slippers caught Evan's eye is because he always calls Sarah, Cinderella. He thought, maybe the glass slippers were a sign. Feeling inspired, but not feeling like that was the right gift, he started looking through the necklaces on display. A light bulb popped in his head.
He thought about how bookworms and sunglass wearers often have a chain or some device that attaches to the arms of the glasses and goes around the neck, so the glasses won't fall off.
He thought how perfect that would be. Sarah didn't leave the glass slipper behind, but she did leave her glasses behind. So, he thought if he got a necklace with tiny little glasses as the charm that hung on the necklace, that would be a unique and special gift with meaning that will last forever. 
Unfortunately, the small store didn't have any necklaces with glasses as a charm.
Evan headed back and scoured every jewelry store he could find with no sign of anything close to what he wanted.
Feeling disappointed, he was about new the mall and seek out similar jewelry stores when he passed by a vintage toy store. In the window, he saw and old-fashioned doll that wearing tiny little glasses.
His frown turned upside down immediately. He couldn't be more excited and ran to the store and purchased the doll. His idea was to buy a silver necklace and is somehow attached the necklace to the doll's glasses.
He went back to the small jewelry store and ask the owner if he could help him attach necklace to toy glasses.
The owner told him he could do it, but it wouldn't last long. It would probably break in the first week. Momentarily feeling down again in the roller coaster of a gift-finding journey, the owner suggested that Evan coded in sterling silver. Small eyehooks can be attached to it which any silver chain could grab onto. 
Evan asked the jeweler if that's something he could get done by Thursday morning.
Normally the jeweler would make a customer wait two weeks for a custom order like this, but he could see how excited Evan was (Evan had told him the story at some point). The jeweler couldn't deny young love, it was a small job anyway, he told Evan to come back the next day, which was Wednesday, and it would be ready half an hour before close.
Evan nervously asked him how much it would cost and was pleasantly surprised that even with the purchase of a silver chain it was well within his budget.
The scene will end with Evan feeling great as he leaves the jewelry store certain that he had found the most special gift he could have possibly even thought of. He was certain that Sarah was going to be pleasantly surprised.

            <Notes>At first, Evan is anxious to find something special for Sarah. Then he sees a glass slipper at a jewelry store that inspires an idea - he's excited. After talking to the jewelry store owner, he goes on a hunt to find special large dool-sized toy glasses that Evan plans to have coded in sterling silver and attached as appended to a chain </Notes>

            <Text>In the early semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, have yet to cross paths. Evan is a charismatic, athletic young man, admired and liked by all, yet keeps his ego in check, thanks to his sister, Liz. He's not an exceptional student, but he promised Liz he'd graduate with a GPA of at least 3.0, so he hits the books despite his preference for the outdoors.
Sarah, however, thrives in academia. She is certain to graduate top of her class and considers the university library her sanctuary. Also, as a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class weekly. One day, engrossed in an audio seminar, she loses track of time. As she rushes from the library, earbuds still in place, she fails to notice the steps in her path.
Evan, spotting Sarah's impending fall, rushes to her rescue. Their collision results in a passionate kiss. Sarah, having promised herself and her father she would avoid romantic entanglements until she starts her professional career, panics and rushes away, leaving behind her glasses without telling Evan her name.
A week later, Evan finds Sarah and returns her repaired glasses. He manages to charm her into a break at the food court. Sarah is stressed by Evan's popularity, especially with the female coeds, and begins to question herself. But Evan convinces her, and they share another passionate kiss before agreeing to a date.
Sarah, out of touch with typical dating protocols, enlists help from Katie Andrews, a student in her Business-101 class, for a makeover and wardrobe update. As she is at the salon, she questions her decision to remain romantically detached during college and decides to approach a relationship with Evan in a businesslike manner. Over dinner, she proposes rules and guidelines for their relationship, prioritizing her academics. Evan agrees, smitten since their first encounter.
Following their successful first date, Sarah becomes more open to romance and affection, while Evan improves academically with her help. Despite the prospect of Sarah pursuing her master's degree in an Ivy League school, they enjoy their time together, not discussing what lies beyond their graduation.
Unknown to Sarah, Evan plans to propose at the graduation party he's organizing with his friend Guido. He surprises her with an invite to her parents and a plaque honoring her academic achievements. Sarah, not having disclosed the depth of her feelings for Evan, panics as she accepts the proposal. She fears disappointing her father and veering from her life plan.
Meeting with her parents after the party, Sarah is given an ultimatum by her father. She can follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him, while still expected to get her master's degree and return to Seattle, or continue with her original plan. If she chooses Evan, she'll lose her father's financial support. Torn between her original plan and her feelings for Evan, she ultimately follows her heart, deciding to build a life with Evan in Chicago.</Text>

            <Text>Rewriting and splitting the scene as requested:

**Scene 1:**
Evan had been strategic, leading Sarah on a route that unavoidably passed the spot of their first kiss. He paused there, gazing at her with an intensity that made her heart thump against her ribs. &quot;I’ve been waiting to kiss you again since the first moment I saw you today,” he confessed, his voice rough.
Gently, Evan's fingers curled around hers, the sensation setting a tremor of awareness coursing through her. &quot;Come with me,&quot; he suggested, his voice as soft and alluring as the hold he had on her hand.
Sarah recoiled slightly, confusion flickering in her eyes. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked, her tone wavering between uncertainty and curiosity.
“I’m holding your hand.” His reply was casual, as though it were the most natural thing in the world. Anticipating her need for an explanation, he added, “I figured it was okay. Everything less than that is allowed once you’ve gone to a certain point with someone. Since we already kissed twice, holding hands seems a given.”
Despite the knots of anxiety tying her stomach into pretzel-like twists, Sarah discovered she couldn't quite fight off the lure of Evan’s infectious confidence. His logic was faultless, and the thought occurred to her—That does make sense!—adding an almost humorous slant to her internal dilemma. As they meandered through the bustling food court, immersed in the vibrant chatter that encapsulated the university's social scene, she felt her hand comfortably nestle into his. 
The food court was a vibrant hub of activity. Students moved to and fro, their laughter and discussions creating an ambient hum that echoed around the vast space. The air was rich with the tantalizing scent of food from different cultures, and the murals that adorned the walls injected a youthful energy into the surroundings. Amid the chaos and noise, Sarah and Evan stood out, their hands interlocked in a silent promise of an unforeseen journey.
But with every passing minute, Sarah’s unease grew. The constant acknowledgement Evan received from the other students, the knowing looks, and the insinuating whispers from the predominantly female crowd were disconcerting. She wondered if she'd become an intruder in his world. She began to question why he had chosen her of all people. 
With an unexpected prompt from Evan, they found themselves seated at a table, the noise and activity of the food court reduced to a dull hum in the background. Evan returned shortly with bottles of water and fruit cups, a simple and light snack as per Sarah’s request.
They began with the basics. An exchange of names, of basic introductions. But when Evan asked her to share something about herself, she found herself caught in an awkward limbo. Nervousness snuck up on her, strangling her words and turning her eloquent academic accomplishments into a frantic, tumble of phrases. 
As the minutes passed, Sarah could feel the weight of awkwardness settle over them. The thrill of their earlier encounter was rapidly giving way to her self-doubt and anxiety. When it became too much, Sarah fled. Her flight triggered by her own insecurities, fear, and uncertainty.

**Scene 2:**

Evan was quick on his feet. He chased after her, calling out, “Hey, Cinderella, wait up, wait up!” His voice echoed around her as he finally caught up.

She stopped abruptly, pivoting to face him. Her eyes were wide, her breaths quick. “Why do you call me Cinderella?”

“Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”

His words were a playful challenge, one that made her insides twist uncomfortably. “Why do you keep pursuing me? It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.” 

They both knew she had a point. Their worlds were vastly different, their paths almost impossible to align. But Evan persisted. He wanted to understand her, get to know her. But more importantly, he wanted her to see that he was not intimidated by her genius IQ, her different world. He wanted to step into her world, and he wanted her to step into his.

A tug of war ensued, their words, their feelings, and their attraction battling against their different worlds. Their conversation veered from Evan’s popularity among females to Sarah’s commitment to her education and career. Through it all, Evan maintained a relentless interest in Sarah, a spark of fascination that was impossible to ignore.

As their conversation progressed, Sarah found herself slowly crumbling under Evan’s onslaught of well-meaning persuasion. When Evan suggested that they try to find out why they were drawn to each other by going on a date, Sarah was left reeling, her defenses weakening.

His plea for her to enjoy the college life beyond academics was convincing. He posed questions that had her rethinking her carefully laid out plan. Evan had a way of disrupting her thoughts, her rigidity, and she found it both unsettling and invigorating. His kisses didn't help, sending her mind into a tizzy, clouding her usual sharp intelligence.

Despite the whirlwind of feelings, Sarah agreed to go on a date with Evan. A small step, a minor concession, but a step nonetheless. They parted ways with a promise to meet for a date, their connection deepened by the sweet sting of their shared kisses.

            <Title>0143 Sarah and Katie Chat</Title>
            <Text>&quot;Wow, this place is amazing! How many bedrooms are there?&quot; The question resonated in the expansive space.
&quot;Two.&quot; Sarah's response came as a quiet murmur.
&quot;Is your roommate home?&quot; Katie inquired, her visual exploration of the apartment ongoing.
Sarah negated with a shake of her head. &quot;It’s just me. My father insisted I have an extra bedroom that I could use as an office. But I never use the guest room, I prefer to  work at the dining room table where I can spread out, or in my bedroom before I go to sleep.&quot;
The idea of privacy, the luxury of space, left Katie yearning. &quot;I can’t even imagine what it’s like not to share a room. Living in a tiny dorm room with a chatty roommate, makes it impossible to study.&quot;
An understanding hovered between them, thick and unspoken. As Katie's gaze made another sweep across the grand expanse of the apartment, Sarah seized the moment. With the effusive warmth of a mother granting her child a long-cherished wish, she said, &quot;You know, the guest room's always open if you ever need a quiet study sanctuary!&quot;
&quot;Really! Thank you!&quot; With those words, Katie lunged forward and gave Sarah a big hug. Sarah was taken by surprise, her glass of wine tilting precariously, the liquid inside nearly sloshing out onto her hand. But she quickly righted the glass and returned Katie's embrace, welcoming the warmth of her gratitude.
As Katie was about to open her mouth to dive into another subject, the familiar buzz of her cell phone diverted her attention. She quickly glanced at the screen, her eyebrows arching slightly. &quot;Oh, it's Nicole, my hairstylist,&quot; she explained. &quot;She wants to confirm our appointment and she needs a picture of you to start making a plan for your makeover.&quot;
Sarah blinked in surprise but then smiled in response. &quot;Alright, let's do it.&quot;
Katie quickly captured a picture of Sarah, her fingers flying over the phone as she sent the image to Nicole. Within moments, Nicole responded with a flurry of excited emojis, already expressing her eagerness to work on Sarah's transformation. 
Katie asked, &quot;So altogether, including new clothes and hairstylist, what kind of budget are we talking?&quot; 
&quot;No budget constraints, you're in charge!&quot; Sarah said with a playful grin.
Katie's eyes lit up at this and she squealed, clapping her hands in excitement. &quot;Really? Oh, this is going to be so much fun!&quot;
The energy in the room was effervescent, reflecting off Sarah as her own excitement began to bubble up. It was new, this anticipation of a date, of being made over, of possibly breaking her own rules, but it was an invigorating feeling that Sarah welcomed.
Katie, full of curiosity, veered the conversation towards Sarah's dating past. &quot;You said it had been a while since you dated?&quot; She was already conjuring up different makeovers in her mind, ready to transform Sarah for her date.
Sarah admitted, a hint of wistfulness in her voice. 'I haven’t dated since I was 16.'&quot;
&quot;16? Wowza!&quot; Katie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. But she wasn't done probing, her next question laced with a touch of delicacy. &quot;If you don’t mind me asking, are you a...&quot; She paused, &quot;virgin?&quot;
&quot;No, I’m not a virgin,&quot; Sarah confessed, the hesitation barely noticeable. &quot;I experimented for a short time in high school, but I didn't see what was so great about it.&quot;
Katie leaned in closer, her voice a comforting whisper. &quot;It will be way different when you find the right guy.” 
A mischievous twinkle lit up in Sarah's eyes, an expression that silently echoed, &quot;Maybe!?&quot; This was a different Sarah, one who was open to the possibility of something more, something exciting, something like... Evan.
Seizing the moment, Katie ventured to ask, &quot;Do you think Evan may be the right guy?&quot;
The response was immediate, Sarah's smile reaching her eyes as she raised her eyebrows. &quot;He's the right guy if he makes love even half as good as he kisses!&quot; 
Their giggles echoed around the room, the atmosphere brimming with anticipation and the sheer joy of newfound possibilities. The girls were truly ready for a night that promised to be a roller coaster of emotions and revelations.
Katie's head tilted slightly, a silent question in her eyes. The puzzle of how a date came to be from a runner's flight was intriguing. Sarah's words offered the missing piece; Evan had sought her out in the library, persistent and charming. Despite her best attempts to stay true to her policy, she found herself succumbing to the magnetic pull of Evan's appeal.
A knowing smile danced on Katie's lips as she watched Sarah's face transform, a touch of red gracing her cheeks. It was evident; the rule, the policy Sarah had held on to so firmly, had been fractured. A spark of defiance lit up in her eyes, an implicit admission of breaking her no-dating policy.
Katie's features softened into a warm, knowing smile. &quot;So you decided to step beyond your no-dating policy?&quot; Her tone carried no judgment; instead, it was rich with approval, almost as if she had been waiting for Sarah to allow herself this freedom.
Sarah shrugged, a hint of sheepishness creeping into her features. &quot;I didn’t have a choice. Every time he kisses me, I can’t think straight. Since the moment I met him, I haven’t been able to study or focus on anything. All I think about is him. Maybe this date will help clear my mind.&quot;
&quot;Are you hoping this date will lead to something more?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes glinting with mischief.
&quot;I have thought a lot about that. If I could find a way to have a relationship with Evan without being distracted from my work, I would like that. The thought of having someone by my side when attending an event or someone to hang out with here at home, appeals to me. But, I have a feeling it’s not going to be that simple.&quot;
Katie nodded, taking in Sarah's words. &quot;Well, if you ask me, I think you are doing the right thing. You can't let your studies keep you from living your life. There is always a way to make things work. You just have to find your balance.&quot;
Katie said, &quot;We need get going. Let's get you changed into something more fun for our shopping trip. Can we look at your wardrobe? I want to see if there's anything we can use for tonight.”</Text>

            <Title>Abbie Jimenez</Title>
            <Text>The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is the stage for this deliciously fun, romantically tumultuous story that features our two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn. These two have never crossed paths before, and they seem to be complete opposites. 
Evan, a naturally charismatic and outgoing, is the kind of guy everyone on campus gravitates toward. Not just because of his stunning looks or athletic prowess, but because he genuinely treats everyone with kindness and respect. You would think that he is a bookworm just like Sarah, given his desire to maintain a 3.0 GPA, a promise to his amazing sister Liz. But actually, he would rather spend his time exploring the outdoors rather than being cooped up indoors studying.
Sarah, however, is the university's top-notch student, destined to graduate with flying colors. She's not just book-smart; she's also teaching a Business-101 class to freshmen. But that's not all there is to Sarah. Underneath her academic exterior, there's a side of her that hasn't yet had a chance to shine - the side that craves romance and human connection.
Their paths cross in an intense, cinematic moment where Evan saves Sarah from a nasty fall. Sparks fly and a heated, unexpected kiss follows. And just like that, Sarah's world is turned upside down. 
Sarah's been focused on her academics and career goals. She promised herself to avoid romance until after graduation, a pact she also made with her father. Yet, she can't help but be drawn to Evan. And when he finds her again to return her lost glasses, she can't resist his charm anymore. They agree to date, but not before Sarah outlines clear rules to ensure her academic goals aren't compromised. Evan agrees, not because he doesn't care, but because he's hopelessly in love.
Their senior year unfolds into a beautifully chaotic ride. Evan becomes a better student, and Sarah learns to enjoy life beyond her books. But as graduation looms, so do life's big decisions.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan is planning a grand proposal at their graduation party. To make matters more complicated, Evan secretly invites Sarah's parents. Sarah, utterly surprised, says yes, despite knowing she would have to readjust her life plans. Her parents, not fully aware of the depth of their relationship, leave in shock.
Sarah's father later presents her with a choice: stick to their agreed-upon plan of joining him in Seattle after pursuing her Master's or follow her heart with Evan in Chicago. The catch is, if she chooses Evan, she will lose her father's financial support. 
In classic Abbie Jimenez fashion, this tale delivers a high-stakes, emotionally charged decision. Sarah's logical side screams to stick to the plan, but her heart whispers to follow her love for Evan. And just like that, she chooses love. She chooses Evan. And with that, Sarah embarks on her path towards a life filled with love and adventure, a testament to the power of choosing happiness over the expected.</Text>
            <Notes>[This scene is written in the style of Abbie Jimenez, where internal conflicts and emotions are presented with a vibrant and relatable narrative.] </Notes>

            <Title>Sarah's Classroom</Title>
            <Text>Name of the place: Business-101 Classroom 
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign/Urbana
Type of place: Large classroom
What role does this setting play in the story?
As a teacher's assistant, Sarah teaches first-year students enrolled in Business-101 in this large classroom once a week. 
This was the very classroom Sarah rushed into right after sharing her first kiss with Evan. Unusually late, she disrupted her otherwise flawless track record as a teaching assistant. Overwhelmed by the unexpected romantic encounter with Evan, she became uncharacteristically disorganized, jotting down lessons on the board that hadn't even been introduced yet.
In that moment, a more vulnerable and relatable version of Sarah emerged. While her students typically found her classes somewhat monotonous, they were pleasantly surprised by this unexpected shift in her demeanor. Thrown off balance by her interaction with Evan, Sarah managed to instruct in a manner that captivated her students, allowing them to see her in a new light. They realized that Sarah, contrary to their assumptions, was not one-dimensional but had a unique and engaging personality.
A week later, the same room served as the setting for another significant moment. Sarah approached one of her students, Katie, requesting assistance in preparing for her first date since she was a teenager. Eager to help, Katie readily agreed to give Sarah a modern makeover for her impending date with Evan.
Description: 
The University of Illinois boasted a sizable classroom where wisdom echoed off the walls and into the minds of its students. Laid out like a grand theater, the room contained over a dozen rows of tiered seating, reminiscent of the captivating cinematic venues. These rows were broken up into three sections, the flanking ones each housing six seats, while the central section accommodated a more significant twelve.
In an unconventional setting, the room featured no student desks; instead, each seat was designed such that the students could comfortably use their laps as makeshift writing surfaces. Each maroon seat, dark and durable, was affixed to its neighbor, contributing to the seamless, theater-like aesthetic.
Stairs conveniently partitioned the seating sections, providing easy access to each row, all the way up to the back of this spacious room. Looking up, the eyes were met with towering 30-foot ceilings, amplifying the grandeur of the classroom.
The teacher's area was flanked by an expansive whiteboard, dominating the wall space behind it. A wooden podium held court beside a similarly constructed desk, complete with an office chair nestled behind it, providing an organized yet inviting space for the instructor.
Two speakers, adhered to either side of the whiteboard, hung from the wall, ready to amplify the voice of knowledge resonating from the front of the room. The aesthetics of the room were warm yet disciplined, with chestnut-colored wood cladding the walls up to four feet from the ground. Above this wooden adornment, vanilla-painted walls ascended toward the lofty ceiling, providing a soothing contrast to the dark wood below.
Scattered symmetrically on both walls to the left and right of the seating were several identical pieces of neutral geometric artwork, adding a touch of creative elegance to the otherwise academic surroundings. These unobtrusive designs complemented the room's austere charm, contributing to the vibrant yet studious ambiance that permeated this well-loved classroom at the University of Illinois.</Text>
            <Notes>This is the classroom that Sarah went to immediately after Evan's and her’s first kiss. She was late for the first time in her teaching assistant career. When she arrived, she was uncharacteristically frazzled from her first kiss with Evan and started writing on the board material that had not been covered.
We see a more vulnerable and relatable version of Sarah at that moment. Typically her students find her class boring. But unsettled by her experience with Evan, she actually taught in a way the students enjoyed and could relate to. Her student got to see that indeed she does have a personality and is not as one-dimensional as they thought.
A week later, this location provides the venue for the scene where Sarah asks one of her students, Katie, to help her prepare for her first date since she was 16. Katie gladly offers to help Sarah with a modern makeover for her date with Evan.</Notes>

Finding true love and his relationship with Sarah helped Evan overcome his fears, to the point where he proposes to Sarah. He no longer feared love, he cherished it and look forward to growing in love.
What is the character's role in the novel?
Evan protagonist in the story.
Beliefs: 
Evan, believes in the guiding influence of the &quot;Universe&quot; on people's life experiences. While he understands the Universe does not reveal its ultimate plan, he thinks it provides opportunities and signs to help humans navigate their journey.
Why does Evan withdraw and sometimes shut down when his suffering emotional duress?
Although Evan would benefit from talking to others who care about him when he suffers emotionally, he pulls away from others when in emotional pain. The reasons Evan gives for withdrawing when he is suffering are:
He doesn't like to draw attention to himself.
He surmises that the past is the past and cannot be changed. He sees no value in discussing painful memories and experiences that cannot be changed?
Most importantly to Evan, he doesn't want to bring negative energy to others. He would rather pull away and process the pain himself, in solitude. Then when he feels recovered, he crawls out of his hole and brings positive energy to the people around him.
What were Evan's romantic relationships like in college prior to meeting Sarah?
Although Evan doesn't perceive himself as a hopeless romantic, that is who he is. In order to love a woman romantically, he must feel that special chemistry with the woman that cannot be manufactured or faked.
However, Evan doesn't like to be alone, so he still has relationships while he waits for that special connection. Before meeting Sarah, he had never experienced that special chemical connection with anyone else.
Others would describe Evan as having a handful of girlfriends during college before meeting Sarah. However, he never considered the women that he went out with as girlfriends.
If he took a particular liking to a college coed but was not in love with her, he would start paying more attention to her. This special attention often misled these women into thinking he was their boyfriend. Because of Evan's vow to never even date two women at a time, when he would enter into an intimate relationship with the woman he liked but didn't love, he considered that relationship as friends with benefits. However, to the woman, she thought Evan was now her boyfriend.
After a few months in one of these relationships, Evan starts to pull out of the relationship and inadvertently breaks the woman's heart. However, it was college, and relationships were more casual then. So, it was never an overly dramatic situation.
Women just assumed that Evan had a fear of commitment. That wasn't true at all. Evan craved being in a committed relationship, but only if he was madly in love with his partner.
When he met Sarah, all the pieces fell into place for Evan. He fell immediately in love and was more than ready to commit to a relationship and call her his girlfriend. 
So, while others would've considered Sarah his sixth or seven girlfriend during college, Evan considered Sarah his first girlfriend and, ultimately, his first love.
It's important to note, that while Evan attracted the most beautiful women on campus, beauty was not his top priority when it came to his attraction to women. For Evan, attraction was about personality and chemistry.
Is Evan an introvert or an extrovert?
To label Evan as either an introvert or an extrovert would be a mistake. When suffering emotional duress, his propensity to withdraw might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state of being.
On the other hand, because of his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and befriending others, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred to avoid drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by conscious choice, but his good looks and warm personality made him popular. Whether someone were the star quarterback or the worst student in college, Evan would treat everyone kindly.
While Evan did not embrace his popularity, he humbly accepted the situation, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.</Text>

Draft Scene:
[[ Upon exiting the Thai Garden Restaurant, Evan gently took Sarah’s hand and walked her to her car. Neither Sarah nor Evan said much during this time as they both were busy absorbing the night’s events. When they arrived at Sarah’s car, she turned around and leaned against the driver’s side door.]]
[[Evan looked at Sarah deep in her eyes]]  
Evan: “Now I am ready to seal the deal.”
[[ Evan leaned in to kiss a wanting Sarah. This was their longest kissing session to date. The kiss started intimately before transitioning to deep passion. There was a drastic change in energy from the contract negotiations at dinner. ]]
Sarah: “I love the way I feel when you kiss me, but it scares me. You have this power over me. It’s intoxicating. I apologize for my business-like approach. I’ve never had a real romantic relationship before, and I’m struggling with the fear of losing control”
Evan: “Never apologize for being who you are. You have the same power over me. It doesn’t scare me, though. It feels like I have been waiting for you. I’ve never felt this way about anybody before. I understand this is unfamiliar territory for you. I promise I won’t pressure you to do anything before you’re ready.”
[[Sarah donned a sexy smile.]]
Sarah:  “I sense you won’t have to wait too long.”
Evan: [[Asked Hopefully]] “I like the sound of that! I don’t suppose you have time to hang out more tonight?”
Sarah: “Not tonight. My friend Katie is waiting for me back at my apartment. I will be there on Sunday to see your game.” 
[[ Sarah could see that this made Evan happy. ]]
Evan: “I have a gift for you.” 
[[ Evan pulled a box out of his pocket. In the box was a silver pendant attached to a silver chain. The pendant was a tiny set of eyeglasses. ]]
Evan: “May I put this on you, my Cinderella?” 
[[ Sarah turned around so that Evan could put the necklace around her neck. She turned back around to face Evan while holding the pendant in her hand, examining it. She could see the pride on Evan's face, but she was not sure what to make of it. 
Evan could see perplexed look on Sarah's face as she examined. He decided to jump in and share the story of the necklace and how he had it custom-made. as he clasped the necklace on her neck. ]]
Evan: “You know how I call you my Cinderella because you’re always running away from me?” 
[[ Sarah nodded in agreement. ]]
[[I'm going to provide you with what Evan would have said on the date. However, you're free to summarize this and focus more on how Sarah is feeling when Evan tells story.
The reason you don't have to tell is verbatim, is that in scene 0137, the reader was there when Evan was having this necklace and its special charm made. In my feel repetitive for the reader to have Evan relive the details of the finding in making of the pendant, when they just read about it a few chapters ago.
Of course, Sarah needs to hear all the details, that doesn't mean that the reader. Has to hear them along with her.  So use the following paragraphs of information and what you know of scene 0137 to describe what Evan is saying to Sarah. 
Note that it is also okay to include some dialogue from Evan while Sarah is us and tell story it doesn't have to all be narrative, I'll leave that up to you.
So here's an example and Evan might have said to Sarah after giving her the necklace.
Evan: “I wanted to get you something for our date tonight, and I wanted it to be unique. While shopping, I ran across this glass case with a bunch of small Cinderella-type glass slippers and shoes. It turns out people collect these things. They gave me the idea of a necklace with an eyeglass pendant inspired by the glasses you left behind while making your escape.” Sarah smiled embarrassingly at Evan’s comment.
Evan continued, “I couldn’t find any necklaces like that. I shopped at all the toy stores I could find. But I couldn’t find anything that would work. I even tried the toy sections at the department stores, nothing. I was about to give up when I passed by this antique store. And what do you know, the universe plopped an antique doll with the perfect size glasses right in the window for me to see.
I bought the doll and took the glasses to a jeweler to have the glasses attached to a chain. The jeweler suggested dipping it in silver so that it would last forever. Forever sounded good to me, so I had him do that. I mean it to commemorate our first kiss. Whenever you wear it, I want you to remember that magical moment,” Evan said in a soft, sentimental voice. ]]
[[ Teardrops flowed down Sarah’s cheeks. ]]
Sarah: “Thank you, Evan. That’s so romantic and so sweet. I can’t believe I’m crying. I haven’t cried since I was a child.”
[[ Evan pulled Sarah close and hugged her. ]]
“Does that mean you like it?”
[[ If Sarah had seen a necklace with a charm like this without any context. She would've not found it all that appealing. She might even find it juvenile, like something a preteen would wear. However in this situation, she generally saw its beauty and felt its sentiment. It indeed was the perfect gift for her. 
In her mind, at that moment, this necklace stood out far above all of her expensive jewelry that her parents had given her over the years to wear at countless business socials and charity balls. ]]
Sarah: “I love it! It’s the most wonderful, beautiful, stupendous gift I’ve ever received from anybody. I can’t believe I’m going to ask this, but if you kept the doll, may I have it?”
[[ Sarah was shocked at her own desire to have the dowel that Evan got the glasses from. She had no idea what to do with the doll. She can't even remember if she's ever even had a doll. All she knew was that she had to have the doll! – She just had to have it. ]]
Evan: “I will bring it on Sunday,” 
[[ Sarah thanks Evan profusely. Possibly gives him a sensual kiss in gratitude for his gift. Maybe a warm hug as well. ]]
Sarah:  “I don’t want this night to end, but I need to get home. My friend is waiting, and I have an early class tomorrow.”
Evan: “No Worries. Can I ask you for one more thing, maybe two?”
“You sure can,” Sarah replied.
Evan: “Can I get your last name? Maybe a phone number or an email?” Evan joked.
[[ Sarah laughed out loud. ]] 
Sarah: “Of course you can.” 
[[ She handed him a business card and told Evan to text his information to her. They enjoyed one more long passionate kiss before returning home.]]

            <Title>0140 Sarah Asks Katie For Help</Title>
            <Synopsis>After class, Sarah asked Katie to help her prepare for her date with Evan. Katie enthusiastically agrees.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah watched as her Business-101 students hunched over their exams, the silence of concentration heavy in the room. Her gaze landed on Katie Andrews, a freshman with a zest for life as vibrant as her pink-dyed hair. Scribbling on a folded piece of paper, Sarah placed it on Katie's desk. The note held a simple request, Can you meet me after class?
Katie was one of Sarah's brightest students - effervescent and friendly, with an infectious grin. When the last student had packed up and exited the large classroom, Katie made her way up to Sarah's desk.
&quot;Hi, Ms. Wilkins. What’s up?&quot; Katie asked, her brown eyes twinkling with curiosity.
Sarah took a deep breath and launched into the question that had been on her mind. &quot;Thank you for meeting with me. I’ve always admired your style, even though it’s different from mine. I have a first date tonight and want to look appropriate for the evening. I haven’t been on a date in a while, and I’m unsure what to wear.”
Katie's face lit up, &quot;I’d love to help!&quot; she said, brimming with enthusiasm. &quot;Are we talking wardrobe only or full makeover?”
Sarah pondered for a moment. &quot;Whatever you think is best.&quot;
&quot;Really! Oh my gosh, Ms. Wilkins, I would love to do a full makeover! The other girls are going to be so jealous.”
Sarah tilted her head, puzzled. “Why?” 
Katie grinned, revealing the unspoken fantasies of their class. “In this class, it’s every girl’s fantasy to do a makeover on you, and it’s every boy’s fantasy that by day you are this librarian-like professor, but at night you’re a sexy vixen.” She laughed and then added hurriedly, &quot;Oh no, I hope that didn’t sound offensive.&quot;
Shaking her head, Sarah let out a chuckle. “I’m not offended; I understand.” She could appreciate the humor and mild absurdity in Katie's words. &quot;What time is your date?”
“It’s at 7 PM at the Thai Garden Restaurant.”
Katie clapped her hands in excitement. “I heard that place has great food! Do you live off-campus?”
“Yes, I have an apartment about 10 minutes away.”
Katie's smile faltered a bit. &quot;I don’t have a car. Can you pick me up by the freshman dorms in about an hour?”
“I’ll be there,” confirmed Sarah, passing Katie a business card with her cell phone number. 
“Great! I can’t wait.” Katie's grin returned full force, and she threw her arms around Sarah in a spontaneous hug. &quot;If we are going to be friends, I’d like to call you by your first name. Would that be okay?”
Sarah couldn't help but return the hug, the nerves of her impending date temporarily forgotten. “Of course, my name is Sarah.”
&quot;Perfect, Sarah!&quot; Katie's eyes sparkled with anticipation. &quot;Get ready, because we're about to have a blast! It's going to be epic!&quot;</Text>

            <Title>Becky Wade</Title>
            <Text>In the early days of their senior year at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn existed as two separate universes. Unknown to each other, their paths had never crossed until fate decided to play its role.
Evan Vaughn, an embodiment of charm and athletic prowess, found himself loved by many. Despite his popularity, under his sister Liz's nurturing influence, he was a humble soul. From the football team captain to the bespectacled water boy, all received the same treatment of kindness and respect from Evan. 
Even though he had an innate knack for studies, Evan's heart danced outdoors, chasing winds and playing under the azure skies. However, he had given his word to Liz, promising a minimum 3.0 GPA on his graduation. And for Evan, promises were not to be broken, even if it meant sacrificing his favorite pastime for his books. As his GPA teetered close to his self-imposed threshold, Evan found himself headed to the unfamiliar territory of the undergrad library. 
Sarah, in contrast, was a prodigy, bound to be the valedictorian of her class. The library was her sanctuary, her comfort zone where she immersed herself in an audio seminar that held the secret to international business success. Oblivious to time, engrossed in her studies, she was on the brink of a first - being late to teach her Business-101 class. 
Sprinting up the library stairs, her earbuds secured in place, she burst out the door onto a raised campus platform. In her path lay a flight of concrete steps. Seeing her impending tumble, Evan dashed to intercept her. His call fell on her deaf ears, drowned out by the ongoing audio seminar. 
He reached her just in time, their bodies merging in a dance-like twirl, ending in a passionate kiss that set their world ablaze. Sarah, bred in an environment where academics took precedence over romance, was caught off guard. Her inexperienced heart fluttered in confusion. 
Even amidst the whirlwind of emotions, Sarah managed to escape without sharing her identity. Days later, Evan found her and returned her lost glasses. In an attempt to charm his way into her life, Evan invited her for a break at the food court. Despite her initial resistance, Sarah was captivated by Evan's allure. 
But doubts clouded her mind when she observed Evan's popularity, particularly among the coeds. Fleeing to her car, she was intercepted by Evan, their encounter leading to a date and a fiery kiss. 
To prepare for her date, Sarah sought assistance from Katie Andrews, a top student in her class. Together with Katie's hairstylist friend, they updated Sarah's style, giving her a modern look. 
Armed with her new look, Sarah approached her date with Evan like a business deal, setting rules and boundaries for their relationship. She prioritized her academic goals above all. Evan agreed, entranced by the captivating woman in front of him. 
As weeks passed, Sarah's hard exterior melted, exposing her softer, vulnerable side. Their date concluded with another fervent kiss and a memento from Evan that symbolized their unique love story. 
They thrived together, their relationship blossoming as Sarah grew more sociable and Evan improved his academic standing. Sarah's guidance even helped Evan secure a lucrative job in Chicago. However, future plans hung as an unspoken word between them, a mystery wrapped in silent exchanges and stolen kisses.
Unknown to Sarah, Evan planned to propose at their graduation party. Unaware of Evan's intentions, Sarah's parents accepted his invitation, thinking it was to celebrate Sarah's academic achievement. Sarah had downplayed her relationship with Evan to her parents, fearing their disappointment. 
Evan's proposal sent shock waves through Sarah. Torn between her heart's desires and her rationality, she accepted Evan's proposal. As the news sunk in, her parents retreated to their rented penthouse suite, leaving the couple amidst their friends. 
With the party over and her facade of happiness set aside, Sarah dreaded her meeting with her father. She respected him deeply and had always shared his vision until this moment. Sarah was left to face her father's disappointment and the consequences of her actions. 
Her father gave her an ultimatum - either follow Evan to Chicago and build a life there or stick to her initial plan. She had a month to decide, a month to choose between the man she loved and her dreams. 
Sarah was torn between her feelings for Evan and her promise to her father. Evan had an unshakeable bond with his sister, Liz, who lived in Chicago, and he was set to start his job soon. Sarah knew she couldn't ask Evan to uproot his life and wait for her. 
Her head said to follow her initial plan, but her heart was screaming for her to follow Evan. Against all odds, she chose her heart, stepping into an unknown yet exciting future with Evan.</Text>

            <Title>Part 5: No dating policy</Title>
            <Text>Katie's head tilted slightly, a silent question in her eyes. The puzzle of how a date came to be from a runner's flight was intriguing. Sarah's words offered the missing piece; Evan had sought her out in the library, persistent and charming. Despite her best attempts to stay true to her policy, she found herself succumbing to the magnetic pull of Evan's appeal.
A knowing smile danced on Katie's lips as she watched Sarah's face transform, a touch of red gracing her cheeks. It was evident; the rule, the policy Sarah had held on to so firmly, had been fractured. A spark of defiance lit up in her eyes, an implicit admission of breaking her no-dating policy.
Katie's features softened into a warm, knowing smile. &quot;So you decided to step beyond your no-dating policy?&quot; Her tone carried no judgment; instead, it was rich with approval, almost as if she had been waiting for Sarah to allow herself this freedom.
Sarah shrugged, a hint of sheepishness creeping into her features. &quot;I didn’t have a choice. Every time he kisses me, I can’t think straight. Since the moment I met him, I haven’t been able to study or focus on anything. All I think about is him. Maybe this date will help clear my mind.&quot;
&quot;Are you hoping this date will lead to something more?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes glinting with mischief.
&quot;I have thought a lot about that. If I could find a way to have a relationship with Evan without being distracted from my work, I would like that. The thought of having someone by my side when attending an event or someone to hang out with here at home, appeals to me. But, I have a feeling it’s not going to be that simple.&quot;
Katie nodded, taking in Sarah's words. &quot;Well, if you ask me, I think you are doing the right thing. You can't let your studies keep you from living your life. There is always a way to make things work. You just have to find your balance.&quot;</Text>

            <Title>Rick Riordan</Title>
            <Text>In the early days of their final year at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, found their paths crossing. Neither Sarah nor Evan had ever encountered each other in their previous years, despite sharing the same university campus. 
Evan was the kind of guy who effortlessly commanded attention, his charm and charisma captivating everyone around him. He was popular, yet his popularity never inflated his ego, thanks to his sister Liz's guidance. He was equally kind to everyone, whether they were the university's star quarterback or the most reclusive bookworm. His academic standing, however, was a different story. 
Evan could've been a stellar student, but he preferred the crisp outside air to a lecture room's stale atmosphere. But he had promised Liz, he'd graduate with at least a 3.0 GPA. His current GPA hovered precariously around the agreed threshold, and to keep his promise, he found himself heading to the library more often than he'd like.
Sarah, on the other hand, was an academic paragon. Graduation saw her at the top of her class, and she considered the library her sanctuary. In her usual spot, she was deeply absorbed in an audio seminar about international business techniques. So absorbed that she lost track of time and risked being late to the Business-101 class she taught once a week. With earbuds still in, Sarah hurriedly ascended the library stairs and burst out onto the university platform.
Evan, recognizing her distracted rush towards the perilous, handrail-less concrete stairs, tried to warn her, but his shouts were drowned out by the seminar still blaring in her ears. He sprinted towards her, aiming to intercept her before the stairs. 
He got there just in time, their bodies colliding in a tango-esque whirl. Their eyes met, and a kiss, fiery and passionate, followed. 
Raised with a single-minded focus on academics and groomed to take over her father's corporate empire after graduation, Sarah had always sidelined romance. Her social life was limited to the elite circles she mingled with during her volunteer work for various nonprofit organizations. Despite her stunning looks, she had minimal experience with love and romance. 
Still in shock and worry about her impending tardiness, Sarah fled, leaving Evan dazed, her name and number unknown to him.
Several days later, Evan found her. He returned the glasses she'd left in her rush, which he'd taken upon himself to repair. Evan, with his disarming charm, eventually persuaded Sarah to take a break. 
At the food court, Sarah began questioning the stark differences between them. She saw how much the other coeds adored him, how outgoing he was, so different from her introverted personality. Fearful, she excused herself and bolted for her car, only to be caught by Evan. Eventually, they agreed to a date, sealed with another passionate kiss.
With no idea what to wear for a date, having not been on one since she was 16, Sarah turned to Katie Andrews, one of her top students in her Business-101 class. With Katie and her stylist friend's help, they modernized her style, swapping glasses for contacts and adding lowlights to her golden locks.
In the salon, she contemplated the implications of breaking her vow of avoiding romance while still in college. If she was going to engage in a relationship, she was going to approach it logically, like a business negotiation.
Their first dinner was akin to a business meeting, with Sarah outlining guidelines for their relationship, emphasizing her goal to graduate at the top. Evan, smitten since their first kiss, agreed, happy to have a relationship built on clarity. One week after their chance encounter, they became an official couple.
As the relationship progressed, Sarah allowed herself to explore the uncharted territories of romance, revealing a side of her that craved affection, a side she didn't know existed until Evan.
They spent the rest of their senior year together, growing and evolving. Sarah discovered her social side while Evan improved his academics, even securing a lucrative job in Chicago thanks to Sarah.
Evan planned to propose at the graduation party, with Sarah's parents secretly invited. They believed the occasion was to celebrate Sarah's academic success. Sarah had kept her relationship with Evan casual to her parents, hiding the depth of her feelings. She feared her father's disappointment, having promised to stick to her academic goals.
Evan's proposal took Sarah by surprise. Though every rational part of her screamed rejection, she said yes. She loved Evan too much to reject him, even if it meant diverting from her planned path and following Evan to Chicago.
After Sarah accepted Evan's proposal, her parents slipped out of the party, leaving Sarah with the impending confrontation. The idea of disappointing her father, someone she respected immensely, was devastating.
After the party, she met her parents. Her father, always fair, gave her two choices: stick to her original plan and attend an Ivy League school or follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him. She had a month to decide.
Evan's bond with his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, was unshakable. She knew she couldn't ask him to abandon his new job and wait for her. She faced a clear choice: stick to her plan or build a life with Evan in Chicago.
Her brain said to follow the plan; her heart said to choose Evan. Against all odds, she followed her heart.</Text>

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                   Part One

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font
used by their house. This PDF file was generated using
Scrivener's compile feature and was created using the &quot;Novel&quot;
project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-
caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

                                                 Chapter Two

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character
during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                   Part Two

                                               Chapter Three

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert the word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt;
Insert &gt; Draft Word Count. (For a manuscript, you may wish to
have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case
select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest
100--this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript,
in fact.)


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In
reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Title>0132 Sarah Relents and agrees to a date</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah's resistance weakens further as she agrees to go on a date with Evan later in the week.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah's feet were brisk against the sidewalk, the rhythm of her steps resonating with the morning's hurried energy. Yet, her speed wasn't enough. She heard Evan's voice calling out behind her, his tone playfully admonishing, &quot;Hey, Cinderella, wait up!&quot;
She halted in her tracks, her heart thrumming in her chest. Turning back, she faced him, a bewildered expression etched on her face. &quot;Why do you call me Cinderella?&quot;
Evan's easy smile danced in the sunlight, as though he were a character plucked straight from a charming romance novel. His eyes, bright with humor, crinkled at the corners. &quot;Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”
“And why are you so adamant about chasing after me?&quot; She countered, a defiant edge lacing her words. &quot;It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.&quot;
Caught in the gravity of his gaze, Sarah noted the determination etched in his features. &quot;I want to learn more about you,&quot; Evan stated simply, standing tall in his conviction. &quot;What’s wrong with that?”
Sarah huffed, her chest rising and falling with the rhythm of her disbelief. &quot;It doesn’t take a genius to see that we exist in different worlds.”
His laughter, unexpected and genuine, echoed around them. “Let me guess. You’re a genius?”
“That’s not my point.”
The tranquility of Evan's demeanor was compelling. His gaze was patient and unwavering as he prompted, “Then what is your point?”
“As a couple, we make little sense. I came to college to get an education and network with professionals to further my academic and professional careers. I committed to focusing on my work and refraining from distracting relationships. You don’t need me. You must know every female on campus.”
Evan smiled, his grin a heartrending blend of sincerity and charm. “Are you jealous? You have nothing to worry about.”
&quot;I’m not jealous. I simply can’t understand why you’re focusing your attention on me,&quot; Sarah replied, her arms crossed over her chest, a physical barrier to the emotions threatening to spill over. Her eyes, brimming with questions, searched his.
Evan looked at her, his gaze reflecting a mix of curiosity and genuine interest. &quot;Maybe the universe meant for us to meet! I don't know, Sarah. There's just something about you. You're different from the girls I'm used to meeting.&quot;
&quot;You don't even know me,&quot; she countered, her voice softer than intended, her gaze shifting to the ground, avoiding his penetrating stare.
He nodded, acknowledging her point. &quot;That's true,&quot; he admitted, a breeze lifting a lock of his hair as he met her gaze again. &quot;But let me ask you something. Why did you kiss me? Why are you here with me now instead of studying?&quot;
Her response was a mere whisper, lost amidst the symphony of the city sounds around them. She shifted on her feet, her foot tracing an absent pattern on the pavement. &quot;Other than the obvious…&quot; she began, implying Evan's good looks. Her voice tapered off to a whisper, &quot;I don't know either.&quot;
A persuasive plea was etched in Evan's eyes as he stepped closer to her, the distance between them shrinking to a mere breath. &quot;Well, let's find out together,&quot; he said earnestly, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Go to dinner with me.”
Silence enveloped them, the sounds of the bustling campus fading into a distant hum. Evan waited for her answer, each second stretching into an eternity. Finally, when the silence had stretched too long, Evan added, “College is about relationships, having fun, trying new things.”
Sarah resisted, but the inner argument she was having with herself was evident in the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes. &quot;I made a plan that makes sense, and I’ve held to it for three years.”
“Doesn’t it make sense to enjoy your college life? To be well-rounded? To pursue new relationships?” Evan countered.
Sarah was exasperated. She wasn’t used to someone challenging her perspective so effectively. “You’ve got my head spinning. It doesn’t help that every time you kiss me, my IQ drops 50 points. How can my plan make so much sense, yet your opposite approach makes sense too?”
His next words caught her off guard. &quot;How can a piece of paper be both thin and wide?”
Before she could formulate an answer, Evan leaned in to kiss her again. The taste of his kiss was sweet and confusing, a turmoil of emotions, leaving her breathless. Pulling back, Evan proposed again. “Thursday night, dinner at seven at the Thai Garden?&quot;
After a moment of hesitance, she relented. &quot;Alright, I’ll meet you there at seven.”
Evan's joy was infectious as he clapped his hands together. “That’s awesome! Can I get your phone number? Your last name?”
&quot;Let’s wait and see how it goes,&quot; Sarah replied cautiously.
He nodded, accepting her boundaries. As she turned to leave, he extended his hand. “May I walk you to your car?”
The walk was silent, their hands intertwined, a silent promise of what was to come. When they reached her car, Evan leaned in, hopeful. “May I get a kiss goodbye?”
“Of course.” She answered, her breath steadier now.
The kiss was long and tender, filled with promises of the potential for something more. Pulling away, Evan teased, “How’s that IQ doing?”
Sarah responded with an unusual attempt at humor. “2+2 equals 10.”
Laughter filled the air, a comforting and intimate sound. When it finally faded, Evan's eyes held a hint of concern. “I’m afraid to let you go. I’m worried you won’t show up on Thursday.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. I never break an appointment unless it’s an emergency.” Sarah's voice was steady, and Evan could see the resolve in her eyes, a promise of the adventure to come.</Text>

            <Title>Danielle Steele</Title>
            <Text>In the picturesque landscape of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, two worlds are destined to collide. Sarah Wilkins, an intellectual luminary, and Evan Vaughn, an endearing athlete, both seniors, are entering their first semester. Their paths have never crossed until one fateful encounter at the undergrad library changes everything. 
Evan, possessing a magnetic charisma, is the golden boy of the campus, charming all who cross his path. But his appeal isn't a matter of choice; rather, it's the natural outcome of his outgoing personality, fostered by his wise and nurturing sister, Liz. Despite his popularity, Evan is not without flaws. His academic performance leaves room for improvement, and he has made a promise to Liz to graduate with at least a 3.0 GPA. As his senior year commences, he trades his beloved Frisbee games for hours of focused study, keeping Liz's promise foremost in his mind.
Sarah, on the other hand, is the epitome of academic brilliance. An ambitious business major, she finds solace in the silence of the library, her ears filled with audio seminars on international business strategies. Time slips away unnoticed in these moments, and one day, she finds herself on the brink of being late to a class she teaches. In a rush, she charges toward the library exit, oblivious to the imminent danger of a flight of stairs devoid of a handrail.
Evan, noticing the potential accident, tries to warn Sarah, but his shouts fall on her earbud-filled ears. With no time to spare, he rushes forward, just in time to catch her before she stumbles. This dramatic save culminates in an impulsive, intense kiss, awakening unexplored feelings in both of them.
Sarah, however, has been reared with a staunch academic focus and ambition to succeed her father at the helm of his multi-million-dollar corporation. The sudden blush of romance with Evan unsettles her. She has, until now, shunned any romantic entanglements, focusing on her academic aspirations.
Despite the confusion, Sarah is irresistibly drawn to Evan. He manages to track her down, returning the glasses she had left behind and charming her into a break at the food court. They embark on a whirlwind romance, with Sarah setting rules and expectations to safeguard her academic priorities. Evan, already enamored by Sarah, gladly agrees to her terms.
The ensuing year is a transformative one. Sarah learns to navigate social circles, and Evan, under Sarah's influence, improves academically. Yet, with graduation looming, Sarah is torn between her commitment to her father and the pull of her heart toward Evan.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan is planning a marriage proposal. On the day of their graduation party, amidst friends and a surprise visit from her parents, Evan pops the question. Sarah, who has underplayed the intensity of their relationship to her parents, is taken aback. 
Her father, a man of stoic but fair character, presents her with a choice - to follow her heart to Chicago with Evan, risking financial support, or to adhere to her initial plan of pursuing her Master's degree and joining her father's corporation. Torn between her mind and her heart, Sarah is faced with a daunting decision.
In the style of Danielle Steel, this story unfolds with high emotion and heart-stirring choices. Against all odds, Sarah's heart emerges victorious, choosing a life with Evan in Chicago over her original plan.</Text>
            <Notes>Style: Danielle Steele. Danielle Steele's novels often involve internal conflict, complicated relationships, and a detailed focus on the protagonist's thoughts and emotions. The dialogue is simple, and there's an undercurrent of romance and hope. Her writing style is also noted for its detailed descriptions, emotionality, and dramatic storytelling. 

[This scene is written in the style of Danielle Steele, with her signature blend of romantic turmoil and emotional upheaval, played out against the backdrop of everyday life.] </Notes>

            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0121 Evan is a Man With a Plan
Characters: Evan
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Time of Day: Morning
Locations: In the car, driving to campus.
Tone: Optimistic, hopeful
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions:
Do not refer to Evan as &quot;penny-pinching.&quot; Stay away from synonyms of that as well. For example, don't use the word frugal when describing Evan. 
Evan was in the car alone. There are no other characters in this scene.
Sequence of Events:
The scene starts with Evan driving to campus in his old but reliable vehicle – a Subaru small SUV with over a hundred thousand miles, about what you'd expect for a financially struggling college student.
The weather was perfect like it was the day he and Sarah met.
He was playing an energetic song on the radio. The Cubs were on a three-game winning streak. His team won their Sunday softball game. Life was Good.
Guido successfully talked Evan out of hours of Internet searching, seeking his mystery girl. 
Guido also convinced Evan what a sorry sight he was sitting in the rain waiting for a woman that would never show. And even if she did, she might find the site of a desperate man unappealing.
This morning, Evan woke up with an inspired idea. He was sure it would meet with success. It was like the Universe planted this thought seed in his mind overnight. He couldn't believe he didn't think of it before.
Upon waking up, he remembered how Sarah was dressed like a professor.  He thought, &quot;She is probably a bookworm. Where do I find a bookworm? The library. Duh!&quot;
This revelation injected an air of confidence in Evan.
When he got to campus, he was going to the spot of their first kiss. If she weren’t there, he wouldn’t wait futilely outside. Instead, he would head down into the undergrad library – where he was certain he would find her.
This scene is primarily a setup scene for the next scene he appears in and finds Sarah in the library as expected. The scene should end with Evan closing his car door, taking a deep breath of the early fall air, and confidently heading to the library. He is excited but not anxious. I want the reader to feel confident along with Evan.

Draft Scene:
&quot;Wow, this place is amazing! How many bedrooms are there?&quot; The question resonated in the expansive space.
&quot;Two.&quot; Sarah's response came as a quiet murmur.
&quot;Is your roommate home?&quot; Katie inquired, her visual exploration of the apartment ongoing.
Sarah negated with a shake of her head. &quot;It’s just me. My father insisted I have an extra bedroom that I could use as an office. But I never use the guest room, I prefer to  work at the dining room table where I can spread out, or in my bedroom before I go to sleep.&quot;
The idea of privacy, the luxury of space, left Katie yearning. &quot;I can’t even imagine what it’s like not to share a room. Living in a tiny dorm room with a chatty roommate, makes it impossible to study.&quot;
An understanding hovered between them, thick and unspoken. As Katie's gaze made another sweep across the grand expanse of the apartment, Sarah seized the moment. With the effusive warmth of a mother granting her child a long-cherished wish, she said, &quot;You know, the guest room's always open if you ever need a quiet study sanctuary!&quot;
&quot;Really! Thank you!&quot; With those words, Katie lunged forward and gave Sarah a big hug. Sarah was taken by surprise, her glass of wine tilting precariously, the liquid inside nearly sloshing out onto her hand. But she quickly righted the glass and returned Katie's embrace, welcoming the warmth of her gratitude.
As Katie was about to open her mouth to dive into another subject, the familiar buzz of her cell phone diverted her attention. She quickly glanced at the screen, her eyebrows arching slightly. &quot;Oh, it's Nicole, my hairstylist,&quot; she explained. &quot;She wants to confirm our appointment and she needs a picture of you to start making a plan for your makeover.&quot;
Sarah blinked in surprise but then smiled in response. &quot;Alright, let's do it.&quot;
Katie quickly captured a picture of Sarah, her fingers flying over the phone as she sent the image to Nicole. Within moments, Nicole responded with a flurry of excited emojis, already expressing her eagerness to work on Sarah's transformation. 
Katie asked, &quot;So altogether, including new clothes and hairstylist, what kind of budget are we talking?&quot; 
&quot;No budget constraints, you're in charge!&quot; Sarah said with a playful grin.
Katie's eyes lit up at this and she squealed, clapping her hands in excitement. &quot;Really? Oh, this is going to be so much fun!&quot;
The energy in the room was effervescent, reflecting off Sarah as her own excitement began to bubble up. It was new, this anticipation of a date, of being made over, of possibly breaking her own rules, but it was an invigorating feeling that Sarah welcomed.

Katie, full of curiosity, veered the conversation towards Sarah's dating past. &quot;You said it had been a while since you dated?&quot; She was already conjuring up different makeovers in her mind, ready to transform Sarah for her date.
Sarah admitted, a hint of wistfulness in her voice. 'I haven’t dated since I was 16.'&quot;
&quot;16? Wowza!&quot; Katie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. But she wasn't done probing, her next question laced with a touch of delicacy. &quot;If you don’t mind me asking, are you a...&quot; She paused, &quot;virgin?&quot;
&quot;No, I’m not a virgin,&quot; Sarah confessed, the hesitation barely noticeable. &quot;I experimented for a short time in high school, but I didn't see what was so great about it.&quot;
Katie leaned in closer, her voice a comforting whisper. &quot;It will be way different when you find the right guy.” 
A mischievous twinkle lit up in Sarah's eyes, an expression that silently echoed, &quot;Maybe!?&quot; This was a different Sarah, one who was open to the possibility of something more, something exciting, something like... Evan.
Seizing the moment, Katie ventured to ask, &quot;Do you think Evan may be the right guy?&quot;
The response was immediate, Sarah's smile reaching her eyes as she raised her eyebrows. &quot;He's the right guy if he makes love even half as good as he kisses!&quot; 
Their giggles echoed around the room, the atmosphere brimming with anticipation and the sheer joy of newfound possibilities. The girls were truly ready for a night that promised to be a roller coaster of emotions and revelations.
Katie's head tilted slightly, a silent question in her eyes. The puzzle of how a date came to be from a runner's flight was intriguing. Sarah's words offered the missing piece; Evan had sought her out in the library, persistent and charming. Despite her best attempts to stay true to her policy, she found herself succumbing to the magnetic pull of Evan's appeal.
A knowing smile danced on Katie's lips as she watched Sarah's face transform, a touch of red gracing her cheeks. It was evident; the rule, the policy Sarah had held on to so firmly, had been fractured. A spark of defiance lit up in her eyes, an implicit admission of breaking her no-dating policy.
Katie's features softened into a warm, knowing smile. &quot;So you decided to step beyond your no-dating policy?&quot; Her tone carried no judgment; instead, it was rich with approval, almost as if she had been waiting for Sarah to allow herself this freedom.
Sarah shrugged, a hint of sheepishness creeping into her features. &quot;I didn’t have a choice. Every time he kisses me, I can’t think straight. Since the moment I met him, I haven’t been able to study or focus on anything. All I think about is him. Maybe this date will help clear my mind.&quot;
&quot;Are you hoping this date will lead to something more?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes glinting with mischief.
&quot;I have thought a lot about that. If I could find a way to have a relationship with Evan without being distracted from my work, I would like that. The thought of having someone by my side when attending an event or someone to hang out with here at home, appeals to me. But, I have a feeling it’s not going to be that simple.&quot;
Katie nodded, taking in Sarah's words. &quot;Well, if you ask me, I think you are doing the right thing. You can't let your studies keep you from living your life. There is always a way to make things work. You just have to find your balance.&quot;
Katie said, &quot;We need get going. Let's get you changed into something more fun for our shopping trip. Can we look at your wardrobe? I want to see if there's anything we can use for tonight.”</Text>

            <Title>0130 Evan and Sarah Food Court Date</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan convinces Sarah to break from her studies and join him at the food court for a snack. Panicked, she runs out on Evan, but he catches up to her outside.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0130 Evan and Sarah Food Court Date
Characters: Evan, Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Locations: Outside the entrance doors to the undergrad library. The area at and around the spot where Evan and Sarah first kissed.
Time of Day: Morning
Tone: Sweet, intriguing, exciting, frantic, and a snipper of subtle humor.
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Previous Scene: In the previous scene, Evan had charmed Sarah into taking a break from her study session in the undergrad library. The scene begins with them exiting the library doors.
Special Instructions: 
I've included a rough first draft. 
Since this is the one and only seen at the food court, I'd like to include a vivid description so that the reader can feel that they are there in the food court with Evan and Sarah. I have a draft narrative you can work off of.
Please review the scene details and rewrite at your discretion.
Food Court Description:
The food court at the University of Illinois is a bustling hub of activity, brimming with the sounds of students engaging in lively conversation, the clatter of trays and dishes, and the aromas of a myriad of different cuisines. The spacious place has high ceilings and a skylight allowing natural light during the day. In the evening, the area is illuminated by an assortment of warm, overhead lights.
Multiple food stalls line the perimeter, offering an international array of food options. From quick bites like burgers and pizzas to various Asian cuisines, Italian pasta dishes, and Mexican delights, the diversity is impressive. There's also a salad bar for those preferring healthier options and an irresistible dessert station filled with sweet treats.
In the center of the food court is a large seating area filled with a mix of chairs, booths, and high tables. The seating arrangements are flexible, accommodating large groups and those who wish to dine alone.
The walls are adorned with vibrant murals depicting various aspects of university life and local landmarks, giving the space a unique, youthful, and energetic vibe.
The atmosphere in the food court is always lively and vibrant, filled with the infectious energy of students refueling between classes, discussing their latest projects, or simply hanging out and enjoying their meals.
Scene Details:
Evan had been strategic, leading Sarah on a route that unavoidably passed the spot of their first kiss. He paused there, gazing at her with an intensity that made her heart thump against her ribs. &quot;I’ve been waiting to kiss you again since the first moment I saw you today,” he confessed, his voice rough.
Gently, Evan's fingers curled around hers, the sensation setting a tremor of awareness coursing through her. &quot;Come with me,&quot; he suggested, his voice as soft and alluring as the hold he had on her hand.
Sarah recoiled slightly, confusion flickering in her eyes. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked, her tone wavering between uncertainty and curiosity.
“I’m holding your hand.” His reply was casual, as though it were the most natural thing in the world. Anticipating her need for an explanation, he added, “I figured it was okay. Everything less than that is allowed once you’ve gone to a certain point with someone. Since we already kissed twice, holding hands seems a given.”
Despite the knots of anxiety tying her stomach into pretzel-like twists, Sarah discovered she couldn't quite fight off the lure of Evan’s infectious confidence. His logic was faultless, and the thought occurred to her—That does make sense!—adding an almost humorous slant to her internal dilemma. As they meandered through the bustling food court, immersed in the vibrant chatter that encapsulated the university's social scene, she felt her hand comfortably nestle into his. 
The food court was a vibrant hub of activity. Students moved to and fro, their laughter and discussions creating an ambient hum that echoed around the vast space. The air was rich with the tantalizing scent of food from different cultures, and the murals that adorned the walls injected a youthful energy into the surroundings. Amid the chaos and noise, Sarah and Evan stood out, their hands interlocked in a silent promise of an unforeseen journey.
But with every passing minute, Sarah’s unease grew. Everywhere they went, students gave Evan friendly nods, simple smiles, or a casual wave of the wrist. The knowing looks and insinuating whispers from the predominantly female crowd were disconcerting. She wondered if she'd become an intruder in his world. She began to question why he had chosen her of all people.
Prompted by Evan, they found themselves seated at a table, the noise and activity of the food court reduced to a dull hum in the background. Evan returned shortly with bottles of water and fruit cups, a simple and light snack as per Sarah’s request.
The exchange began with the basics: their names and simple introductions. But when Evan asked her to share something more about herself, a wave of awkwardness washed over Sarah. She was so accustomed to the structure of professional interactions, the conversational ebb and flow of academic dialogues, that this request for personal detail felt foreign, disarming.
Unconsciously, she slipped into autopilot mode. The socially naive part of her receded, replaced by the poised, articulate woman who had faced countless academic panels and job interviews. With the clinical precision of a resume, she began to list her accomplishments, her words spilling out in an educated, polished tumble of phrases that felt jarringly out of place in the casual environment.
Across the table, Evan watched her, his eyes sparkling with a quiet warmth. He saw her struggle, her resort to what was comfortable and familiar. Instead of interrupting or correcting her, he chose to sit back, a gentle smile playing on his lips. He was attentive, listening to each word with interest, and his expression was one of sheer fascination. There was an undeniable charm in her earnest recital, in the passionate way she recounted her academic accomplishments, in her slight discomfort navigating the unfamiliar waters of personal conversation. In the subtle crinkle of his eyes, the softening of his gaze, anyone looking would see the deepening of Evan’s affection for Sarah, an adoration unphased by her unconventional response.
The silence that hung between them after Sarah finished speaking was palpable, carrying the weight of her misstep. But within Evan's patient gaze, there was no judgment—only an eagerness to know more, to delve deeper into the complex enigma that was Sarah.
As the minutes passed, Sarah could feel the weight of awkwardness settle over them. The thrill of their earlier encounter was rapidly giving way to her self-doubt and anxiety. Overwhelmed, Sarah fled, her flight triggered by her own insecurities, fear, and uncertainty.

Scene Name: 0150 Sarah’s Makeover
Characters: Sarah, Katie, Nicole
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Shear Elegance Hair Salon
Setting: Tucked away in the heart of a vibrant central Illinois lies an unassuming, yet undeniably modern hair salon. Through the large glass facade, the salon's chic and bustling atmosphere beckons to both casual passersby and dedicated customers alike.
Upon crossing the threshold, visitors are met with an airy, open space, replete with the gentle hum of hairdryers, the soft rustle of foil, and the low murmur of friendly conversation. The flooring is a modern marvel, laid out with sleek, polished wooden planks that lend a warm, contemporary touch to the space.
To the right of the entrance, an intimate seating area is neatly arranged. An elegant, tufted couch in a muted gray is flanked by a pair of sleek armchairs. Placed strategically, this area allows Katie to comfortably observe the transformation process from her seat, keeping a watchful eye on Sarah as Nicole works her magic.
Running parallel to the left wall are several state-of-the-art hairstyling stations. Each boasts a large, backlit mirror framed by brushed steel, and a swivel chair upholstered in rich, black leather. Mobile carts filled with an array of high-end hair care products and advanced tools are stationed conveniently next to each chair.
Nicole tends to Sarah at the third station from the entrance, providing a perfect line of sight to Katie from the reflective mirror. The overall lighting is artfully designed to cast an inviting glow over the area, highlighting the natural finishes of the wooden floor and the sophisticated furnishings.
Adding a touch of biophilia, strategically placed potted plants bring a sense of calm and vitality to the salon. The back wall serves as a stylish product display, with lit glass shelves housing an impressive range of premium hair care products and styling tools.
Tucked in the back corner of the salon, a glass partition subtly separates the wash station from the main area. Here, plush, reclining chairs face ceramic sinks, each equipped with modern showerheads, providing a comfortable and relaxing hair-washing experience for clients.
With its soft background music and contemporary aesthetic, this small-town salon rivals its big-city counterparts, promising clients not just a hairstyling appointment, but a luxury experience that caters to their modern tastes.
Tone: Exciting, hopeful, anticipatory, friendly
Weather: Partly cloudy and nice outside.

Draft Scene:
[[This is the one and only time that this salon will be the setting in the story. Whenever I introduce a new location, I like to start the scene off with a description as the characters enter the scene. Use the &quot;Setting: &quot; marker in this template for a detailed description.]]
Nicole: Katie’s hairstylist, Nicole Jenkins, was just finishing up with a client when Katie and Sarah arrived at her salon. “Have a seat. I’ll be with you in a second” 
[[Nicole finished with the client, cleaned up, and called for Katie and Sarah to come to her station.]]
Nicole: [[A surprised Nicole took one look at Sarah, then turned to Katie]] “Is this the same girl that’s in the picture you sent?”
Katie: “Amazing what a pair of jeans and some contact lenses can do. Nicole, this is my dear friend, Sarah. Sarah, this is my friend and stylist, Nicole.”
Sarah: “It’s a pleasure to meet you” [[Sarah extended her hand out for a hand shake.]]
Nicole: [[Nicole shook Sarah’s hand]]  “Nice to meet you as well.”
[[Describe Nicole as she seats Sarah]]
Nicole:  “Have a seat Sarah. What are we doing today?“
Katie: “The works!”
Nicole: [[Nicole took a minute or two before speaking.]] “This is unusual for me. On my website, I have before and after pictures of my makeovers. You already look like an ‘after’ girl. What do you think, Katie?”
Katie: “She is stunning, but I think we need to change things up. Are you okay with that, Sarah?”
Sarah: “Whatever you both decide is fine with me, as long as my hair will still be appropriate for professional occasions.”
Nicole: “Here’s what I think we should do.“As pretty as you are, you’re one shade of white—fair skin, blonde hair, etc. I say let’s add some low lights. Also, we’ll straighten your hair and cut a few inches off the bottom. Not only will you look super-hot for your date tonight, but it will look great for any professional engagement! How does that sound?” asked Nicole.
Katie: “That sounds great!”
Sarah: “Works for me!” 
[[Sarah being so unmanageable to change shows the reader, that at least for tonight she is truly embracing the moment]]
[[Nicole made a plan in her head.]] 
Nicole: “We’ll get your hair started right away; then we’ll do a full mani-pedi, wax your brows, and finish with your makeup.”
[[Katie played games on her phone while Nicole placed the low lights in Sarah’s hair. Once all the foil was in place, Nicole worked on Sarah’s mani-pedi.]]
Nicole: “Tell me about this guy your dating tonight.”
Sarah: “I know little about him. All I know is his name is Evan.”
Katie: “I’m sure I can dig up some information on him. Is he a student? A senior?” 
Sarah: “I am not sure, but he seemed to know everybody. I would guess he is a senior or least an upperclassman.”
Katie: “Hmm, I think that’s enough information. There can’t be that many Evans. Let me text my roommate’s sister. She’s a senior and knows many people. In the meantime, I’ll Google him and see what I find.”
Nicole: “Where is your date tonight?”
[[Katie answered for Sarah]] 
Katie: “He’s taking her to that nice Thai place on Kirby Avenue! She could use some dating tips; this is her first date since high school.”
Nicole: “That’s surprising! I’ve dated my fair share of men. My best advice for you would be to be yourself tonight. Don’t pretend to be something you’re not. That never works out. Are you nervous?”
[[Sarah tells the girls that she is more confused and disoriented and nervous. She explained she so use to dealing with situations analytically, not emotionally.]]
Katie: “Analytical or not, Sarah, you’re still a woman. I saw the way your face lit up when you told me about how he kissed you. Where is the analysis and that?”
Sarah: “You have a point there. I guess I embraced the feeling, but I can’t live in that place forever. I need to find some resolution tonight, so I can get back to focusing on my real life.”
Nicole: “Resolution?”
Sarah: “I like the idea of having a boyfriend, but I need to make sure the relationship doesn’t distract me from my goals.”
Nicole: “A relationship? Don’t you think it might be too soon to talk about that? It might scare him away.” 
Katie:  “I think I might’ve found him! Do you know if he works as a personal trainer?”
Sarah: “Could be. He’s got the body for it.” 
[[Katie opened the website for a local fitness center and navigated to the personal trainer section.]]
Katie:  “Wow! Is this him?” 
[[Katie showed Evan’s picture on her phone to Sarah.]]
“Yep, that’s him!” Sarah said with a bit of pride in her voice.
[[Katie showed the picture to Nicole]]
Nicole:  “He is hot!”
Katie: “His full name is Evan Vaughn. Let me text his name to my roommate’s sister and let’s see what we can find out!” 
[[A few minutes later, the texts started rolling in.]] 
Katie: “Were you walking around campus holding his hand the other day?” 
Sarah: “Yes, and it was horrible; everybody was staring at us like we committed some kind of crime or something.” 
[[Katie let out a long, loud laugh as she sent a text.]] 
Katie: “You’re the mystery woman!”
Sarah: “Mystery woman?” 
Katie: “The reason everyone was staring at you two was that they thought Evan was dating a professor” [[she continued to crack up laughing as she spoke]]. “It was scandalous!”
[[Nicole joined in the laughing fest, but Sarah was not amused.]] “I don’t know why people can’t mind their own business.”
[[The conversation was quiet for a few moments while Katie read through her texts.]] “If it’s any consolation, girl, you hit the jackpot! My friend says this guy is highly coveted. Let me see if I can get some more details.” 
[[Katie sent out a few texts and waited for replies.]]
Nicole: “It sounds promising so far!”
[[Katie read through her texts.]] 
Katie: “Here’s the scoop. The consensus is that he is a great guy, but you should avoid his best friend, Guido. Evan has had a few girlfriends since he has been here but doesn’t seem to be looking for anything serious. Does that bother you?”
Sarah: “That’s perfect for me. The last thing I need is a serious relationship. A companion for a while, or maybe for the school year, has appeal. Anything more might derail me.”
A couple of hours later and the makeover was complete. 
[[Nicole turned the chair around so Sarah could look into the mirror and stated]] 
Nicole: “My work here is done!”
Katie: “Sarah, you look incredible– hotter than hot! Like I knew you would! No one is going to mistake you for a professor tonight. I can’t wait to go shopping for a new outfit to match your new look.”
[[Sarah stared at herself for a few minutes in the mirror]]
Nicole:  “Do you not like it?” 
“It’s incredible. This situation is all overwhelming and surreal. I think it’s just now registering that I’m about to go on a date with a guy I hardly know and break my number one rule.”
Nicole attempted to comfort Sarah. “Try not to make such a big deal about it. It is just a first date. Use this as an opportunity to get to know him better and then see where it goes.”
[[Sarah thanked Nicole, paid her bill, leaving her a huge tip. She and Katie then headed out to do some shopping. ]]
Sarah: “Katie, would you mind staying in my apartment while I’m on my date? If you like, we can stop by your dorm so you can grab clothes and study material and stay the night. I feel like I might need a friend before the night is over.”
[[Katie gave Sarah a big warm hug]]
Katie:  “Of course I’ll be there for you.”</Text>

Draft Scene:
[[ Sarah opened the door to her apartment, stepped in, closed the door behind her, then leaned back against the door and let out a tremendous sigh. She felt a mixture of emotions including but not limited to, vibratory, relieved, orgasmic, weightless. ]]
Katie: “I am guessing by the look on your face that the date went well?”
Sarah: “It was perfect,” 
[[ Sarah sighed again. ]]
[[ And excited Katie jumped up and down and gave Sarah a big hug.]] 
Katie: “I’m so happy for you, Sarah. Come sit down, let’s talk.”
[[ Sarah followed Katie to the couch. When they sat down, she showed Katie her pendant. ]]
Sarah: “Evan calls me his Cinderella because I’m always trying to run away from him like it’s midnight.” 
[[ Sarah explained the full meaning behind the necklace. She also described the process by which Evan had it made for her. The retelling of the necklace story brought tears to both of their eyes. ]]
Katie: “Oh, Sarah, that’s so romantic. I swear you are the luckiest woman I know.”
Sarah: “I feel like the luckiest woman alive!” 
[[ Sarah’s phone buzzed with a Facebook message. It was a relationship request from Evan. She showed the Facebook message to Katie. ]]
Sarah: “Evan wants me to confirm that we’re in a relationship.”
Katie: “Are you in a relationship?” 
[[ Sarah smiled and nodded, yes. ]] 
Katie: “Wow, you move fast! Are you going to confirm it?”
Sarah: “I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to do anything more in my life,” 
[[ She pressed the on-screen button to confirm to Facebook that she and Evan are in a relationship. ]]
Katie: “I can’t wait for all the details. You are glowing!”
Sarah: “I feel incredible, Katie! In a single day, I have a new amazing friend and a new amazing boyfriend. For the first time, I feel like a normal woman!” 
[[ Have Katie cup her hands over her heart or similar silent gesture or facial expression to show how touched she is when Sarah called her and amazing new friend. maybe insert that into the middle of the dialogue line above. Where you think it fits best.  ]]
[[ Sarah repeated herself as she thrust back against the cushion in jubilation. ]] 
Sarah: “A normal woman!”
[[ Either through dialogue to Katie or through internal thoughts, this is a good time for Sarah to think or say that while in the past, she was critical of the girls that seemed to spend all their time chattering about boys, she finally understands what it's like to have these romantic feelings for a man. She finally knows where feels like to be kissed romantically. She finally gets it, and she loves these feelings of emotion. 
In this moment at least, she would trade this endorphin-laced moment of ecstasy, for every rational thought she's ever had.
We want to leave the reader feeling how Sarah feels at this moment. ]]

            <Synopsis>Katie’s hairdresser gives Sarah a makeover.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Tucked away in the heart of vibrant central Illinois lay Shear Elegance Hair Salon, an unassuming, yet undeniably modern hair salon. Through the large glass façade, the salon's chic and bustling atmosphere beckoned to both casual passersby and dedicated customers alike. The partly cloudy and pleasant weather outside contrasted with the salon's warm interior, filled with the gentle hum of hairdryers, the soft rustle of foil, and the low murmur of friendly conversation.
Katie's hairstylist, Nicole Jenkins, was finishing up with a client when Katie and Sarah arrived at her salon. &quot;Have a seat. I'll be with you in a second,&quot; she called, flashing a welcoming smile. Her station, the third from the entrance, provided a perfect line of sight to Katie, who sat on the elegant, tufted couch.
Soon, Nicole finished with the client, cleaned up, and called for Katie and Sarah to come to her station. Her eyes widened as she took in Sarah's appearance. &quot;Is this the same girl in the picture you sent?&quot; she asked Katie, her voice laced with surprise.
&quot;Amazing what a pair of jeans and some contact lenses can do,&quot; Katie chuckled. &quot;Nicole, this is my dear friend, Sarah. Sarah, this is my friend and stylist, Nicole.&quot;
They greeted each other with a warm handshake.
Nicole's eyes studied Sarah's features as she guided her to the swivel chair upholstered in rich, black leather. The salon's contemporary aesthetic and the wooden floor’s natural finishes created a backdrop that emphasized Nicole's professionalism. &quot;Have a seat, Sarah. What are we doing today?&quot; Nicole asked, her voice filled with anticipation.
&quot;The works!&quot; Katie exclaimed, her face lighting up.
Nicole took a minute or two before speaking, her eyes still fixed on Sarah. &quot;This is unusual for me. On my website, I have before and after pictures of my makeovers. You already look like an 'after' girl. What do you think, Katie?&quot;
&quot;She is stunning, but I think we need to change things up. Are you okay with that, Sarah?&quot; Katie asked, her tone both excited and reassuring.
&quot;Whatever you both decide is fine with me, as long as my hair will still be appropriate for professional occasions,&quot; Sarah replied, her voice firm yet trusting.
&quot;Here's what I think we should do. As pretty as you are, you're one shade of light color—fair skin, blonde hair, etc. I say let's add some low lights. Also, we'll straighten your hair and cut a few inches off the bottom. Not only will you look super-hot for your date tonight, but it will look great for any professional engagement! How does that sound?&quot; Nicole asked, her eyes sparkling with ideas.
&quot;That sounds great!&quot; Katie chimed in; her excitement was palpable.
&quot;Works for me!&quot; Sarah agreed, her willingness to embrace change reflecting a newfound excitement.
They settled into a comfortable rhythm as Nicole worked her magic. Katie played games on her phone while Nicole placed the low lights in Sarah's hair, then moved on to her mani-pedi. The conversation flowed naturally, with the women's voices weaving together in the open space of the salon.
&quot;Tell me about this guy you're dating tonight,&quot; Nicole asked, her voice curious.
&quot;I know little about him. All I know is his name is Evan,&quot; Sarah replied, her voice tinged with intrigue.
&quot;I'm sure I can dig up some information on him. Is he a student? A senior?&quot; Katie asked, her fingers already typing on her phone.
&quot;I'm not sure, but he seemed to know everybody. I would guess he is a senior or at least an upperclassman,&quot; Sarah said, her curiosity growing.
&quot;Hmm, I think that's enough information. There can't be that many Evans. Let me text my roommate's sister. She's a senior and knows a lot of people. In the meantime, I'll Google him and see what I find,&quot; Katie said, her voice filled with determination.
Nicole asked, “Where is your date tonight?”
“He’s taking her to that nice Thai place on Kirby Avenue! She could use some dating tips; this is her first date since high school,” Katie answered for Sarah.
Nicole raised an eyebrow, “Since high school!? That’s surprising.”
She paused, her eyes narrowing slightly as she considered her next words carefully. Memories of past dates and relationships seemed to flit across her face. Finally, she nodded to herself and continued, “I’ve dated my fair share of men. My best advice for you would be to be yourself tonight. Don’t pretend to be something you’re not. That never works out. Are you nervous?”
Sarah felt a twinge of confusion, her head tilting slightly. “I’m more confused and disoriented than nervous. I’m used to dealing with situations analytically, not emotionally.”
Katie laughed, “Analytical or not, Sarah, you’re still a woman. I saw how your face lit up when you told me about how he kissed you. Where is the analysis in that?”
“You have a point there,” Sarah conceded, shifting uncomfortably in her seat as she considered the words. Maybe I am getting ahead of myself. “I guess I embraced the feeling, but I can’t live in that place forever. I need to find some resolution tonight, so I can get back to focusing on my real life.”
Nicole frowned, her eyebrows drawing together in concern. “Resolution?”
“I like the idea of having a boyfriend, but I need to make sure the relationship doesn’t distract me from my goals,” Sarah explained, her hands nervously playing with the edge of the tablecloth.
Nicole’s eyes widened, her mouth slightly agape. “A relationship? Don’t you think it might be too soon to talk about that? It might scare him away.”
“I think I might’ve found him!” Katie interjected, her face lighting up as she held up her phone. “Do you know if he works as a personal trainer?”
“Could be. He’s got the body for it,” Sarah replied, a slight blush coloring her cheeks.
Katie then opened the website for a local fitness center and navigated to the personal trainer section, showing Evan’s picture to Sarah. “Wow! Is this him?”
“Yep, that’s him!” Sarah said, pride in her voice, her chest puffing out slightly. Katie showed the picture to Nicole.
“He is hot!” Nicole exclaimed, leaning forward to get a closer look.
Katie grinned, her eyes twinkling with mischief. “His full name is Evan Vaughn. Let me text my roommate’s sister his name, and let’s see what we can find out!”
A few minutes later, the texts started rolling in. Katie looked up, her expression curious. “Were you walking around campus holding his hand the other day?”
“Yes, and it was horrible; everybody was staring at us like we committed some kind of crime or something,” Sarah recalled, her face crinkling in distaste.
Katie let out a long, loud laugh as she sent a text, her body shaking with amusement. “You’re the mystery woman!”
“Mystery woman?” Sarah repeated, perplexed, her head tilting to one side.
Katie continued to crack up laughing as she spoke, “The reason everyone was staring at you two was that they thought Evan was dating a professor. It was scandalous!”
Nicole joined in the laughing fest, but Sarah was not amused; her lips pursed tightly. “I don’t know why people can’t mind their own business.”
The conversation was quiet for a few moments while Katie read through her texts, the room filled with the soft sound of her thumb scrolling. Then she said, “If it’s any consolation, girl, you hit the jackpot! My friend says this guy is highly coveted. Let me see if I can get some more details.”
Katie read through her texts and said, “Here’s the scoop. The consensus is that he is a great guy, but you should avoid his best friend, Guido. Evan has had a few girlfriends since he has been here but doesn’t seem to be looking for anything serious. Does that bother you?”
“That’s perfect for me. The last thing I need is a serious relationship. A companion for a while, or maybe for the school year, has appeal. Anything more might derail me,” Sarah responded.
A couple of hours later, the makeover was complete. Nicole turned the chair around so Sarah could look into the mirror and stated, “My work here is done!”
“Sarah, you look incredible– hotter than hot! Like I knew you would! No one is going to mistake you for a professor tonight. I can’t wait to go shopping for a new outfit to match your new look,” Katie cheered.
Sarah stared at herself for a few minutes in the mirror, disbelief etched in her wide eyes. Nicole asked, her voice tinged with uncertainty, “Do you not like it?”
“It’s incredible. This situation is all overwhelming and surreal. I think it’s just now registering that I’m about to go on a date with a guy I hardly know and break my number one rule,” Sarah admitted, her voice full of mixed emotions, her hands trembling slightly.
Nicole attempted to comfort Sarah, and Katie chimed in, “Try not to make such a big deal about it. It is just a first date. Use this as an opportunity to get to know him better and see where it goes.”
Sarah looked at Katie, “Katie, would you mind staying in my apartment while I’m on my date? If you like, we can stop by your dorm so you can grab clothes and study materials and stay the night. I might need a friend before the night is over.”
Katie hugged Sarah warmly, her eyes filled with understanding and support. “Of course, I’ll be there for you.”</Text>

            <Notes>Maybe have a coffee or drink offer from Sarah
Maybe rewrite the first paragraph


Let's expand and animate this part of the scene. I can see Katie awestruck in real life when she walks into a luxury apartment, but to Sarah, it's commonplace. 
While Katie pauses and marvels at this place, maybe walks to the window and looks out the window, Sarah would likely veer off in a separate direction to her kitchen and get something to drink – perhaps wine or coffee or water. In contrast to Sarah, Katie might tell Sarah how great the department is, maybe how incredible the view is. Sarah might offer her something to drink, as anyone would when a new guest comes to their apartment. 
Have Katie accept the drink, and then have Sarah tell Katie to have a seat on her couch. Sarah can then bring her drink to her, sit down and start their chat.
Here are a couple of things to note as you rebuild the first part of this scene. Champaign, Illinois is a small town, so there won't be any extensive city views. If you describe the view out the window, let's have Sarah's apartment look out into an expansive preservation area—lots of trees and greenery with a small appealing creek running through the nature preserve.
I want to start the scene with the reader feeling like there with Sarah and Katie. Right now, it feels like they're just two people talking anywhere. I want to immerse the reader into the scene.
Please rewrite and expand that first paragraph if that's enough to work with. If you need more information, let me know. Were brainstorming here, you have free reign to express your thoughts and ideas.</Notes>

            <Title>0115 Sarah is Frazzled</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah arrives at her class uncharacteristically five minutes late. The typically well-prepared, professional Sarah finds herself frazzled but turns it into a well-received class session.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0115 Sarah is Frazzled
Characters: Sarah, Katie
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Sarah's Classroom
Tone: Sarah was frantic at the beginning of class but had an epiphany. She decided to embrace the moment, relax, and conduct a more collaborative teaching session – a  stark contrast from her typical one-way lecture teaching style.
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
Start the scene with a vivid description of the location as defined in the location profile.
Include the confusion and mixed energy of the class as they look at a vacant podium and wonder where their always punctual teacher's assistant, Sarah, is.
The dialogue provided may be used or changed at your discretion.
Sequence of Events:
Sarah arrived 10 minutes late to her Business-101 class. However, that was not the biggest shock for her students. They had never seen their teacher without her glasses on or with her long hair let down.
Hoping to hide the internal chaos she was feeling, she straightened her outfit and her expression. 
Sarah: “I apologize for being late. It will not happen again. Today we will review topics on next week’s exam.”
She wrote on the board. One student raised his hand. “Ms. Wilkins, we have never discussed that material.”
Still lightheaded from her kiss with Evan, Sarah inadvertently wrote information relating to the next section of the course. She took a deep breath, walked to the front of her desk, leaned back in a semi-seated position, and chose a fresh approach to the review session. 
Sarah: “Did you ever have one of those days where something happens that you didn’t expect, and it throws you off your game?”
Most of the class smiled and acknowledged they could relate.
Sarah: “Today is one of those days for me.”
In stark contrast to her usually dry and monotone teaching style, Sarah spoke in a relaxed, relatable tone.
Sarah: “Let me tell you a secret about exams. 80% of the questions simply test your memorization. The other 20% are often trick questions to gauge how thoroughly you understand the material. Let's focus on the trick questions instead of wasting time on simple questions. I think this will give everybody a better chance to ace this exam. Is everyone agreeable to that?”
The vote was unanimous. The students were excited they might enjoy Sarah’s class for once. After the session ended, one student, Katie Andrews, stopped by the teacher’s desk.
Katie: “Ms. Wilkins, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed our class today. Whatever happened, I hope will happen again next week!” 
Sarah thought “Me Too!”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Sarah and Katie arrived at Sarah's apartment. Katie falls in love with the luxurious apartment. With Sarah now feeling Katie is a friend, she offers a delighted Katie use of guestroom anytime Katie needs a study sanctuary.</Synopsis>
            <Text>As they entered the upscale, modern apartment, Sarah and Katie naturally diverged. For Katie, unaccustomed to such luxury, the entire space was a marvel. She was entranced, her gaze traveling over the tastefully minimalist decor, pristine cleanliness, and the blend of modern furniture. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view of an untouched nature preserve in central Illinois—an unexpected gem, offering a green oasis laced with a shimmering creek.
&quot;Wow, Sarah, your place is amazing!&quot; Katie marveled, her voice slightly echoing in the vast space. She found herself gravitating toward the panoramic view, her footfalls soft against the gleaming hardwood floor.
In response, Sarah, already heading toward the kitchen, dismissively gestured with her hand. &quot;It's just home,&quot; she called back. &quot;Make yourself comfortable, Katie. Want something to drink? Coffee? Water? Or maybe a glass of wine?&quot;
Katie, still mesmerized by the vast preserve, turned at Sarah's words. &quot;Oh, I'd love some wine, but still a few years away,&quot; she said with a smirk. &quot;Better make it water.&quot;
Sarah let out a chuckle, &quot;Oh, I didn't even think about that,&quot; she admitted, her tone light and amused.
Katie said, &quot;You must be rich!&quot;
&quot;I'm not, but my father is. He owns a large corporation and pays the bills.&quot; Sarah explained as she finished pouring the drinks. She  gestured to the plush seating area that faced the scenic outdoors. &quot;Have a seat on the couch.&quot; 
Katie's youthful energy was infectious, her eyes wide with awe and excitement. &quot;Oh, my God! I love this place!&quot; Her voice rang out with pure delight, echoing around the room before she took an arm's open, playful back plunge onto the couch, her body sinking comfortably into its plush cushions. Her laughter filled the room, a joyful melody wrapped around them like a comforting blanket.
Holding a glass of chilled wine in one hand and a glass of water in the other, Sarah watched with a smile playing on her lips. She was amused by Katie's genuine delight, the vibrancy in the younger woman's eyes reflecting a life very different from her own. 
Sarah gracefully handed Katie the glass of water, then nestled into the other end of the couch, curling her legs underneath her. She held her glass of wine comfortably as she faced Katie, their eyes meeting in a silent agreement to embark on a girlish chat.</Text>

            <Notes>

Rewrite this paragraph. 
“A silence settled between them, dense and tangible. Sarah watched as Katie's gaze took another spin around the room before she extended a friendly hand. &quot;If you like, you can use my place if you need to study for a big test or just need some quiet time.&quot;”
Let’s have Sarah say something like “The guest rooms your to use anytime you need a study sanctuary!”
Sarah offers this to Katie, almost like a mother would offer her child a pony the child thought she could never have.

Characters: Guido, Jewelry Store Owner
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Location: A Local Mall
Tone: Anxious, excited, anticipatory, intense/focused

Special Instructions: 
In the sequence of events section, I provide some ideas of what might be done and spoken. You have full discretion to write this scene the way you feel works best.
Summary:
Evan headed to the mall to look for a special piece of jewelry that he could buy as a gift given to Sarah on their first date. He didn’t know what he was looking for, but he felt confident that he will find something special. 
He went from jewelry store to jewelry store and jewelry department to jewelry department of chain stores – without any luck. Just about to give up, he came upon a small privately owned jewelry store located in a somewhat hidden corner of the mall.
He saw something interesting he had never seen before. It was  a display case with tiny glass slippers– averaging about 3 to 4 inches in width.
He walked in and talked to the owner about the glass slippers. The jewelry store owner explained that people collect these tiny glass slippers and put them in a curio cabinet at home or on display somewhere. They are simply ornamental knickknacks.
The reason that the glass slippers caught Evan's eye is because he always calls Sarah, Cinderella. He thought, maybe the glass slippers were a sign. Feeling inspired, but not feeling like that was the right gift, he started looking through the necklaces on display. A light bulb popped in his head.
He thought about how bookworms and sunglass wearers often have a chain or some device that attaches to the arms of the glasses and goes around the neck, so the glasses won't fall off.
He thought how perfect that would be. Sarah didn't leave the glass slipper behind, but she did leave her glasses behind. So, he thought if he got a necklace with tiny little glasses as the charm that hung on the necklace, that would be a unique and special gift with meaning that will last forever. 
Unfortunately, the small store didn't have any necklaces with glasses as a charm.
Evan headed back and scoured every jewelry store he could find with no sign of anything close to what he wanted.
Feeling disappointed, he was about new the mall and seek out similar jewelry stores when he passed by a vintage toy store. In the window, he saw and old-fashioned doll that wearing tiny little glasses.
His frown turned upside down immediately. He couldn't be more excited and ran to the store and purchased the doll. His idea was to buy a silver necklace and is somehow attached the necklace to the doll's glasses.
He went back to the small jewelry store and ask the owner if he could help him attach necklace to toy glasses.
The owner told him he could do it, but it wouldn't last long. It would probably break in the first week. Momentarily feeling down again in the roller coaster of a gift-finding journey, the owner suggested that Evan coded in sterling silver. Small eyehooks can be attached to it which any silver chain could grab onto. 
Evan asked the jeweler if that's something he could get done by Thursday morning.
Normally the jeweler would make a customer wait two weeks for a custom order like this, but he could see how excited Evan was (Evan had told him the story at some point). The jeweler couldn't deny young love, it was a small job anyway, he told Evan to come back the next day, which was Wednesday, and it would be ready half an hour before close.
Evan nervously asked him how much it would cost and was pleasantly surprised that even with the purchase of a silver chain it was well within his budget.
The scene will end with Evan feeling great as he leaves the jewelry store certain that he had found the most special gift he could have possibly even thought of. He was certain that Sarah was going to be pleasantly surprised.

What role does this setting play in the story? 
This location plays a vital role because this is where Evan and Sarah have their first kiss—affectionately known as &quot;The Kiss&quot; by Evan's friends and family. Sarah was rushing to class and wasn't paying attention to her surroundings. She was seconds away and falling down the stairs, but then Evan swooped in to save her, and they kissed in the heat of the moment.
Description: 
Not far from the library’s exit are four concrete steps leading downward. It's important to note that the railings for these concrete steps are few and far between. The staircase itself is over 40 feet wide. If one is not paying attention, it would be easy to take a hard fall on the concrete steps, where a railing may be too far away to spirit someone the fall.</Text>

Scene:
The anticipation in Sarah’s apartment was palpable. Cloud-filtered sunlight spilled through the windows, casting an encouraging glow on the room. With a swing of her arm, Sarah revealed the contents of her bedroom closet to Katie. It was an organized array, divided into clear categories: business attire, formal dresses, and a rather underpopulated section of casual clothes.
Katie's eyes widened at the sight of the designer dresses hanging with an air of elegance. &quot;Are these designer?&quot; she gasped.
Sarah nodded, a smile lighting up her face. &quot;Yes, they are.&quot;
&quot;They're stunning but a tad too much for tonight's date. Do you wear these often?&quot; Katie asked, her fingers tracing the smooth fabric of a crimson gown.
&quot;All the time,&quot; Sarah responded, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. &quot;My father believes in contributing to the community. It's also a great networking strategy and looks impressive on a resume. I coordinate events for various nonprofits in the area, and almost every week, I attend a fundraiser or a business social.&quot;
Katie's brows raised in surprise. &quot;I never knew you led such an interesting life. But for tonight, these dresses won't do. We need to head to the mall for the perfect outfit. And I'm not letting you go shopping dressed like a corporate executive.&quot; Katie chuckled, pulling a pair of jeans and a top from the casual section and tossing them towards Sarah. 
&quot;Do you have contacts?&quot; Katie asked, as Sarah caught the clothes deftly.
&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; Sarah confirmed.
&quot;Great! Change into these, put your contacts in, and trade that bun for a ponytail. Do you have a Facebook account?&quot; Katie continued, her energy infectious.
[[Have Katie explain to Sarah (and our readers) that she wants to look at Sarah’s Facebook to get a sense of how Sarah looks in different dresses and colors. If you want to add more, you can have Katie say something like, &quot;We are in a bit of a time crunch, so the more I know now, the better.&quot;]]
&quot;I do, yes,&quot; Sarah replied, slightly taken aback by Katie's whirlwind of commands.
&quot;Do you mind if I browse while you get ready? &quot; 
Sarah shrugged. &quot;Sure. You can log in using the laptop on the table.&quot;
With Sarah's approval, Katie went to the dining room, leaving Sarah to change. Her transformation began as Sarah swapped her glasses for contacts and her skirt suit for jeans and a T-shirt. By the time she emerged from her room, her hair in a loose ponytail, she looked like a different person. 
Immersed in Sarah's Facebook profile, Katie looked up and audibly gasped. &quot;Wow, Sarah. What a difference a few simple changes can make. You look great!&quot; 
Sarah blushed under the compliment, feeling her confidence buoyed by her friend's words. &quot;Thanks, Katie,&quot; she responded, her voice soft.
[[Add a comment by Katie, saying something like “But we are going to make you look even greater than great and hotter than hot! Evan won’t know what hit him.” You have complete discretion  in your response.]] 
The air around them crackled with the prospect of what was to come. Their shared anticipation for the forthcoming shopping spree makeover painted broad, excited smiles on their faces.</Text>

            <Title>Plot Summaries</Title>
            <Notes>For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his nurturing sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy. 
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments. 
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz. 
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds, listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally. 
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything. 
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls. 
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs. 
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss. 
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire. 
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career. 
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age. 
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number. 
A few days later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself. 
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break. 
At the food court, Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car. 
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment. 
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews. 
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart. 
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class. 
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations. Just one week after the first kiss, Evan and Sarah were romantic partners.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan. 
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss. 
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together. 
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel. 
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit. 
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him. 
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals. 
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago. 
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person. 
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle. 
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s unshakable bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan. 
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.

            <Title>Evan Deep POV</Title>
            <Text>Of course, let's transform that scene into a deep POV from Evan's perspective:

Sunlight was a sweet molasses, slow and golden, as Evan took in the sight of the library doors flying open. A woman emerged, her earbuds plugged in and a look of sheer panic washing over her face. Her skirt suit flapped about as she broke into a sprint, lost in her world of haste and earphone chatter.

Skirt Suit, he mentally nicknamed her. He didn’t know her. She was a faceless figure among many, soon to stumble down the concrete stairs with no railing. 

&quot;Hey, Skirt Suit!&quot; His voice knifed through the air, a futile attempt at catching her attention. A chorus of chuckles rose from the students in the quad, but Skirt Suit was deaf to his warning. She was seconds from disaster.

His muscles sprung into action. He darted forward, adrenaline surging through his veins. He managed to grasp her just as her foot slipped. Their bodies spun in a chaotic dance, her momentum swinging her backward in an unexpected dip. Her purse, briefcase, and their contents erupted into a messy cloud around them. The world reduced to just him, her, and the beating of his heart against his ribcage.

As her hair tumbled down from its bun, brushing the ground, and her glasses slipped from her face, he found himself staring into the eyes of a student, not a professor. Their gaze locked. Heat bloomed in his cheeks, and a reckless thought spiraled through his mind.

&quot;I feel like I should kiss you.&quot; The words slipped out before he could stop them. To his surprise, a smile tugged at her lips.

&quot;I am not going to stop you.&quot; Her voice was barely a whisper.

He closed the gap between them, his lips finding hers in a passionate promise. He pulled back to steady her on her feet, his pulse humming in his ears.

&quot;What's your name?&quot; he asked, his voice slightly winded.

She didn’t answer, too frantic as she gathered her scattered belongings. &quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot;

&quot;That's a strange name.&quot; He couldn't help but chuckle.

But she was already sprinting off, a whirlwind of skirts and hastily gathered items, leaving behind her glasses. He stooped down to pick them up, a small token of a surreal encounter. She was just a speck in the distance now. Holding up the glasses high, he called out to her, but to no avail.

He stood there for a while, Sarah's glasses in hand, a lighthearted grin tugging at his lips. This was an unexpected turn of events, one that promised a chance encounter he looked forward to.</Text>

            <Text>Closes to my original:
Refrain from adding new lines of dialogue unless absolutely necessary for coherence or character development. I'd like the narrative to weave seamlessly around the original dialogue, providing connective tissue between the lines of speech rather than introducing new plot points or revelations.

Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. While the narrative description is important for setting the scene and expressing the characters' internal thoughts, I prefer a heavier emphasis on dialogue to carry the scene forward. Allow the characters' words and interactions to reveal their personalities and the nuances of the situation.
Prioritize My dialogue:
Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. I'm particularly interested in maintaining the authentic voice of my characters and the specific flow of the conversation.
Add Depth to Dialogue:
Please ensure the scene is not dominated by dialogue. Integrate some narrative description and action into the dialogue to add depth and create a more dynamic scene. Avoid having many lines of dialogue without any breaks in between. Keep the characters 'doing' things while they're talking, making the scene more lively and engaging.


* Conclude each scene with an evocative image or action that naturally implies an end or transition, without explicitly stating the scene is ending.
To have all of your scenes written in the style of Nicholas Sparks, you can include the following instruction in your custom instructions:
&quot;Please write all scenes in the style of Nicholas Sparks. Infuse each scene with emotional depth, heartfelt descriptions, and a touch of romantic intrigue. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the characters' emotions and surroundings. Capture the essence of tender beauty and poetic language in each narrative. Ensure that the scenes evoke a strong emotional response and resonate with the reader on an emotional level.&quot;
Please preserve my original dialogue as much as possible. It's important that the dialogue serves as the primary driver of the scene. Use narrative description primarily to supplement the dialogue, providing context, mood, and introspection, but not steering the main course of events.
Use the narrative to enhance the existing dialogue, emphasizing character emotions, internal thoughts, and the setting as necessary. However, ensure the dialogue remains the central mechanism for moving the plot forward.
Integrate dialogue tags an action tags at your full discretion. 
Remove all speaker labels identified by the character name followed by a colon and a space. Example &quot;Sarah: &quot;

Please prioritize 'showing' over 'telling' in this scene. I'd like the narrative to convey emotions, actions, and settings through descriptive language, character interactions, and dialogue, rather than directly stating them. Aim to make the scene vivid and immersive, allowing readers to infer and visualize details.&quot; </Text>

            <Title>0122 Sarah Can't Concentrate</Title>
            <Text>The Undergraduate Library was abuzz with the clatter of keystrokes, the murmur of hushed conversations, and the low hum of fluorescent lights overhead. It was a cocoon of industry, a hive of collegiate life, and its energy was as palpable as it was contagious. Groups of students huddled around tables, their brows furrowed in concentration, their voices a soft chatter. In the corners, amidst the maze of books, the library also nurtured tentative friendships and budding flirtations.
Yet, today, for Sarah, the lively hum and vibrant buzz were background noise. She was elsewhere, trapped in her thoughts, her mind a whirlpool of images and sensations, all converging on one moment – the kiss.
Sarah had always been a disciplined student. She prided herself on her ability to block out distractions, to focus, to absorb the information that swam across the pages in front of her. But today, every line she read, every fact she tried to internalize, it all blurred into an indistinguishable mass, drowned out by the memory of a stolen kiss.
Why is this happening to me? Sarah wondered. She nervously fidgeted with her glasses, cleaning the lenses more out of habit than necessity. But the lenses weren't the problem. It was the relentless film that played on the screen of her mind, a replay of an unexpected, yet passionately heart-stopping kiss.
In an attempt to shake off her mental fog, she started to tidy her work area. Pens were aligned, notebooks stacked, eraser bits brushed away. She picked up her purse and methodically checked its contents, putting everything back in a precise order.
In the back of her mind, the logical part of her brain told her to snap out of it, to regain her focus. It reminded her of her vow to keep romantic entanglements at bay. But the other part, the part that seemed to be in control today, yearned for more. More of the mystery man, more of his touch, more of the sparks that had ignited between them.
I have to get back to my work, she admonished herself as she roamed the aisles aimlessly, her fingers running over the spines of books she had no intention of reading. 
The tension was building, a mix of frustration and yearning. In a small act of surrender to her distracted state, she gathered her hair, twisting it into a bun at the top of her head. It was an unconscious act, an echo of countless study sessions in the past.
Is this what attraction to the masculine feels like? Sarah mused, her heart pounding a little faster as the memory of the kiss washed over her again. How does a woman get any work done? 
Sarah, the diligent student, the disciplined scholar, was facing a new challenge. It wasn't an academic hurdle or an intellectual puzzle. It was something far more uncontrollable, far more overwhelming. It was desire. And she was lost in it, unable to find her way back to the safety of her books. For the first time in her academic career, she was grateful for her habitual over-preparedness. But even that relief was fleeting, swept away by a new wave of memories and longing. 
She was no longer just Sarah, the focused student, the valedictorian. She was Sarah, the woman yearning for a man's touch, Sarah, who craved for just one more kiss. It was a struggle, an internal tug-of-war that left her reeling and distracted. The library, once a sanctuary of knowledge, had become the stage for her emotional unrest, a symbol of the turmoil within her. And she had no idea how to handle it.</Text>

She put her earbuds in and listened to an audio seminar on best practices in real estate law. She had posited earlier but wanted something to keep her mind occupied while she walked to the train station.
She exited her office building doors and walked on a sizeable flat brick-paved platform with four concrete stairs leading downward.
Her pace was fast because she was in a bit of a panic.
Her mind was preoccupied with concerns about tardiness and the voice coming through her earbuds.
Evan had never met Sarah.
He saw she was not paying attention and was only a few feet away from the concrete stairs with no railing.
He called out to warn her. He shouted, “Hey lady and the skirt suit!&quot; everyone heard him except the lady in the skirt suit.
He didn't know if he could make it, but he took off at high speed to try and stop her before she fell on the concrete stairs with no railing.
He caught her just in time, but the momentum of her fast pace caused her body to swing around as if they were in a dance and he was dipping her.
Her briefcase and purse went flying everywhere.
She found herself leaning back almost parallel to the ground.
Evan was bent over facing her, his hands supporting her back.
Their eyes connected, and they gazed longingly at each other.
Finally, Evan leaned down and kissed Sarah. It was a deep passionate kiss.
After the kiss, Evan lifted Sarah back to her feet.
She remembered how late she was and frantically gathered her belongings with Evan's assistance.
Evan asked her her name.
Out of sorts, she responded, &quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot;
Evan laughed and said, &quot;That's a strange name.&quot;
Sarah was too out of sorts to recognize she brought unintended humor to this romantically charged moment.
Being bewildered and frantic, Sarah dashed off toward the train station.</Text>

            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0120 Waiting Game
Characters: Evan, Guido
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Locations: Outside the entrance doors to the undergrad library. The area at and around the spot where Evan and Sarah first kissed.
Tone: The scene starts with Evan hopeful. But as the rain began to drizzle down on him, Evan watched hundreds of people come in and out of the library, none of them being Sarah. With no sight of her, he gradually got sadder and sadder.
Guido came to check on him and successfully got Evan to stop torturing himself at that location and head back to their apartment. 
Guido was also able to instill a bit of hope in Evan.
The scene does a full circle when it comes to Tone. The scene starts with hope,  turns to disappointment, sadness, and then despair before returning to a muted version of hope.
Weather: Cloudy, drizzly
Special Instructions: 
Since there is no dialogue in the first part of this scene, focus on Evan's thoughts and feelings as his emotions roller coaster at first before heading down a steep decline until Guido arrived. I really want the reader to suffer along with Evan. Integrating the increasingly gloomy weather and aligning it with his mood deterioration is essential to help the reader visualize Evans suffering.
Although Guido was not considered a nurturing or compassionate human being, I would like the reader to see he does have a caring side, even if his method of expressing that care is not typical of what others might do.
Even though Guido doesn't really understand why Evan is so distressed, he wanted to be there for his best friend in whatever way he could. 
The dialogue and narratives I have provided may be used as is or changed at your discretion.
Understanding the precise spot where Evan and Sarah had their first kiss is essential. The kiss happened outside in an open, uncovered area on four concrete stairs leading downward from a flat platform. Evan had saved her from a fall, leading to a passionate kiss. The actual spot where they kissed was at least 30 feet from the library entrance.
In the scene, I don't want the reader to think that Evan is stood right in front of the library doors watching people come and go. In his 2-hour, Evan shifts from place to place but never gets too close to the kissing spot or the library entry and exit doors. He is always at least 20 are 30 feet away. I don't want the reader to think Evan is overly pathetic or so desperate that he must stand just 2 feet from the kissing spot or the library entrance doors.
Sequence of Events:
Evan returned to the location where he and Sarah first kissed. He was feeling hopeful, but his hope was diminished a bit, still feeling the disappointment from her not returning to this spot the Friday before.
It was Monday. He figured he had a better chance of seeing her again if he skipped the weekend and returned on a school day. 
His excitement with yo-yo every time he caught a glimpse of blonde hair in his periphery. Every time the door to the undergrad library opened, his heart would skip a beat, thinking it would be her. But she was nowhere to be found.
As time rolled by, the rain rolled in. It started drizzling about half an hour into his wait and continually worsened for another 90 minutes.
Evan had a jacket on but didn't think to bring an umbrella. He did his best to find trees and awnings to stand under to help keep them dry. But he refused to pick any spot that didn't give him a direct view of the library doors and the place where he and Sarah first kissed—his effort to remain dry produced minimal results.
After Evan had been there a couple of hours, Guido came to check on him.
Guido: &quot;No Luck?”
Evan looked dejected. With his head down, he said, &quot;No, I haven't seen her.&quot;
Guido provided his version of consolation, &quot;Sorry, bro. Don't stress it. There are plenty of fish in the sea.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't want to fish in the sea. She's the only one for me.&quot;
Guido: &quot;I don't get you, bro. You got women lined up to be with you, and you're stressing over a girl whose name you don't know? You should adopt my style – no strings attached, no drama.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Yeah, and no hope for love.&quot;
In a way, Guido admired Evan. Guido chuckled. &quot;My friend, ever the hopeless romantic.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm just... I'm just...just…&quot; Evan couldn't find the words to express his sentiment. Frustrated, he said, &quot;I don't know what I am. I just know that I have to see my Cinderella again.&quot;
Guido felt for Evan. Guido joked. &quot;Let's leave the matching glass slipper search for another day. Come on, let's head back to our place. We’ll knock down a few beers and watch baseball. The Cubs actually have a chance for the playoffs this year!&quot;
Evan remained silent but didn't appear ready to go with Guido.
Guido gently persisted. &quot;You'll feel a lot better with a cold brew in your hand and a Cubs victory on the TV. I’ll tell you what, after the game, we’ll try to figure a way to get her name.&quot;
Evan, still silent, was not yet persuaded.
Guido joked, &quot;How hard can it be to find the most beautiful girl on campus?&quot;
Guido's words brought a small smile to Evan's face. 
 Evan: &quot;I suppose you're right. I'll bump into her sooner or later.&quot;
Guido: &quot;Exactly! Let's chill at home, and we’ll scour the Internet when the game ends.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Thanks, dude. I feel better already.&quot;
Nothing more was said as they headed home. The scene ends here. I want the reader to feel Evan's contrasting motions of disappointment that he didn't see Sarah and hope that inevitably he'll find his way to her.&quot;

Of secondary importance, she would like to be married and have a child to raise like she was raised. However, she would only want a child if it didn’t interfere with her professional aspirations.
Education background: 
She graduated as valedictorian from Ballard  High School in Seattle.
She is in his senior year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Working on earning a Bachelor's Degree in Business. 
Family/general background: 
Sarah Wilkins, an only child, was a beacon of exceptionalism, born and bred for success. Raised in a household where playdates and frivolous activities were forsaken for the grandeur of academia, Sarah found herself immersed in an ocean of knowledge from an early age. Her childhood revolved around devouring non-fiction educational books, her imagination flickering not with tales of adventure but with the enlightening prose of fact and theory.
Her parents, particularly her domineering father, were the rudder that steered the ship of her life. The University of Illinois, her father's alma mater, became Sarah's undergraduate choice despite being capable of securing a scholarship to any institution across the country. Even with the allure of prestigious Ivy League schools for her postgraduate studies, the sense of legacy and deference to her father's wishes guided her decision.
Sarah's relationship with her father was less traditional and more of a mentorship, a catalyst that stimulated her thirst for learning. Their household, punctuated by an omnipresent stoicism, eschewed affection for mutual respect. Hugs were a rarity, with personal growth and intellectual achievement held on a higher pedestal.
Sarah was a paragon of her parents' molding, embracing the rigorous standards they set for her. Her extraordinarily high IQ melded seamlessly with their crafted path, creating an academic prodigy poised for greatness. Valedictorian of her high school, she graduated college with the same top honors, her formidable pre-college resume testament to her commitment and prowess.
In the whirlwind of academia, Sarah found herself baffled by the incessant chatter of girls concerning boys. While she wasn't entirely immune to the fluttering feelings of attraction, dating was more of an anthropological study for her. She wanted to decipher the energy and time girls dedicated to boys, a concept alien to her own mindset.
As she transitioned to college, Sarah made a pact with herself: no dalliances, no romantic distractions. Her goal was singular - acquire her master's degree, lay the foundation of a successful professional life. It was a pledge set in stone, the echo of her parents' teachings resonating within her, guiding her towards the brilliance they had prepared her for.
Relationship status/history: 
In high school, Sarah experimented briefly with boys. She wasn't a virgin when she started college but had minimal experience compared to other females her age.
Before meeting Evan, she honored her commitment to avoid all romantic entanglements in college.
Health history: 
Sarah was meticulous regarding self-care. Her dietary habits would impress the strictest of nutritionists. She was religious in her exercise routine, combining time indoors at the gym and jogging and biking outdoors.
Interestingly, Sarah's motivation to keep healthy and fit had little to do with vanity or lifespan. Instead, she always wants to look presentable and confident in business meetings, negotiations, and social events from philanthropic endeavors and business ventures.
How does the character handle stress or crisis situations?  
Sarah is as stoic as they come. She is calm under pressure. Her high IQ and business brilliance often lead to quickly resolving any crisis.
What motivates this character? 
Even before Sarah began her high school journey, her path forward was as clear as a sunlit highway. She would be the valedictorian of her graduating class – this wasn't a possibility; it was an expectation. Such was the certainty of her brilliance and the weight of the destiny she felt she had been handed down.
The University of Illinois was the stepping stone, a nod to her father's legacy. Once there, she intended to dominate the academic charts, rising as cream does to the top. Her sights, though, were firmly set on the gleaming towers of the Ivy League for her master's degree, an ambition as naturally conceived as a sunflower turning towards the sun.
College was not just about academics for Sarah. It was an opportunity to broaden her connections and foster relationships within circles of influence and wealth. Her philanthropic endeavors, while rooted in a sincere desire to make a difference, also served the dual purpose of positioning her within networks of power. Every charity event attended, every fundraiser led, they were stepping stones on the path to fulfilling her destiny.
Primary Goal: Sarah's ultimate goal was to replace her father as CEO of his multi-million dollar corporation.
Key Conflict: 
Sarah's heart was entangled in a fierce battle between her love for Evan and her father's carefully crafted life plan for her. On one hand, there was Evan, the man who had ignited her soul and shown her a world of love and emotional depth she had never known. He challenged her to embrace vulnerability and live for the moment, beckoning her to break free from the rigid confines of her predestined path.
On the other hand, there was her father, the respected figure whose expectations had guided her every step. The thought of disappointing him weighed heavily on her, as she had always strived to be the embodiment of his ambitions and aspirations. But as she stood at this critical crossroad, Sarah knew that whichever choice she made, an important man in her life would be left disheartened. The weight of the decision pressed upon her like a relentless storm, and she yearned for a way to reconcile her heart's desires with the legacy she was meant to fulfill.
What is the character's role in the novel? 
Sarah's role is the protagonist and female love interest. The story revolves around her unexpected romance with Evan. We see throughout the story that she fights her feelings for Evan along the way. But his charm and persistence shatters her resistance. Ultimately, she chooses her love for Evan over her promise to  her father. After the elopement, she wonder if she made the best choice.
What are some of the character’s key life events: 
Her decision to break a rule about dating in college.

The only clothes that are designer are her workout clothes.

I am currently working on Sarah's profile. I wanted to include a narrative description. Please write a description of Sarah given the following bullet points.
Sarah was an only child.
Her birth/maiden name is Sarah Wilkins.
From birth, her parents raised her for success.
There were no play dates or dance classes for Sarah. Instead, her parents focused on academics. As a child, Sarah devoted extracurricular time to expanding her knowledge base, primarily by reading non-fiction educational books.
Sarah was the valedictorian of her high school and graduated top of her class in college.
Her focus in high school was academics. Her pre-college resume was formidable. She could get a full scholarship at any university in the country. She planned to attend a prestigious Ivy League university for her master's degree. However, she attended the University of Illinois for undergrad work because that was her father's alma mater.
Sarah's father played a dominant role in his marriage. His wife was submissive and dutiful.
Sarah respected her father.
Sarah's relationship with her father was more mentor/mentee than father/daughter.
The Wilkins household was stoic. The three household members respected each other, but affection was minimal. There weren't many hugs in Sarah's childhood.
Sarah embraced the way that she was raised. She had an extraordinarily high IQ, and her parent's method of reading her for success made a lot of sense.
In high school, Sarah could never understand why girls spent so much time talking about boys. However, she did find herself occasionally being attracted to a boy.
She did date a few times in high school but did it more to find out why girls spend so much energy on boys than it was because she was interested in them.
When it was time for college, Sarah promised herself she would not get caught up in the social trappings that college life can bring. She decided to avoid all romantic relationships until she achieved her master's degree and was ready to start her professional life.

I am working on explaining Sarah's motivation. Please write a narrative based on the following bullet points:
Sarah's future was written in stone before she started high school.
She expected to graduate valedictorian of her high school class.
She expected to be top of her class at the University of Illinois and whatever Ivy League school she decided to attend for her master's degree.
She was to spend her free time on philanthropic endeavors during her college years. In part to give back to the community. But also to build contacts and relationships with other wealthy men and women in the business world.
After she obtained her master's degree, she would take a position at her father's corporation. She wouldn't be starting at an entry-level, but also wouldn't start in upper management. Her father wanted her to climb the corporate ladder through effort, diligence, and skill – not nepotism.
Sarah was particularly interested in expanding her father's corporate dealings overseas. Her father's company had a minimal presence outside the United States. She was looking to make a name for herself through successful expansion internationally.
Ultimately, her final goal was to replace her father as the CEO of his multimillion-dollar corporation when he retired.
As far as her personal life, she had decided to one day marry a successful man similar to her father. However, while she respected her mother, Sarah did not want to play the role of a supportive wife. She wanted to play the role of an equal partner in a marriage. She wanted one and only one child that she would raise in the way that she was raised.

Please provide a narrative to explain why Sarah asked for a divorce with Evan giving the following bullet points:
Sarah loved Evan very much.
He was the only one who could tap into that more feminine, affectionate part of her that was inaccessible and invisible to everyone else.
Sarah felt uncomfortable with the emotional aspects that Evan exposed. She didn't like feeling controlled by her emotions. She felt critical of other women who seemed imprisoned by their feelings and didn't want that.
She regretted not following her lifelong goals. Even though she was successful in her own right with Evan, she craved returning to her plan and working at her father's corporation.
She knew that Evan loved her and would follow her anywhere she went. But in her heart of hearts, she realized they would never be in sync. Additionally, she couldn't move him so from his sister, Liz. Evan Liz had such a special bond. 
Seattle was so far from Chicago, and Sarah worried that would negatively impact Evan and Liz's brother-sister connection.
She walked out on Evan without attempting to negotiate with him as she always had in past differences because she knew he would connect with her deeper emotional self like he did when he asked her to marry him. She knew Evan, well-meaning as he would have been, would have caused her to make a decision she would later regret. 
She was committed to achieving her lifelong goal; even her love for Evan would not stand in the way. To her credit, she considered this the best decision for Evan, even if he couldn't see it at the time.

The dance floor, a significant feature of the ballroom, stretches out invitingly in front of the stage. Its polished wooden surface, reflecting the soft, colorful glow of strategically placed LED lights, tempts even the most reserved attendees to let loose and dance. Positioned to encourage interaction and fun, the dance floor becomes the heart of the party, pulsating with energy and laughter.
The ballroom's high ceiling enhances the sense of space, accommodating the 30-40 party-goers comfortably. A series of chic, crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling, casting a soft, inviting light throughout the room. Ambient wall sconces complement the chandeliers, ensuring the room is well-lit yet retains an intimate feel.
Round tables draped in crisp, white linens and adorned with minimalistic centerpieces are strategically arranged around the dance floor. Each seats four to six guests, promoting comfortable conversation and interaction among the party-goers. 
On one side of the room, a long, buffet-style table offers a selection of refreshments and finger foods, ideal for refueling during the festivities. On the opposite side, a well-stocked bar serves a variety of drinks, tended by a friendly, skilled bartender. 
Despite its formal setting, the Grand Ballroom exudes a youthful charm, making it a fitting location for a gathering of exuberant college students. The setting, while sophisticated, is infused with an infectious energy that inspires camaraderie, fun, and perhaps a touch of romance among its young guests.

            <Title>0120 Waiting Game</Title>
            <Text>Evan stood under the dreary clouds, a gray blanket unfurling across the morning sky. The location, the same place where he and Sarah first kissed, filled him with a sense of hopeful anticipation. It was Friday, the day after the unforgettable kiss, and he found himself drawn back, a hopeful pilgrim to a shrine of his own making.
He oscillated between hope and disappointment like a pendulum, his heart racing every time a blonde head appeared in his peripheral vision or the doors to the undergrad library swung open. Yet, each time, it wasn't her. The figure would solidify into a stranger, and the library doors would admit someone else, causing his heart to drop in his chest. 
As the minutes turned into hours, the weather started to mirror his gloom. The rain began, a soft drizzle that escalated steadily, soaking through his jacket. He darted between trees and awnings, attempting to stay dry, but he wouldn't stray far from his post. His need for a direct view of the library doors and the place of their first kiss kept him exposed to the elements. The rain, initially a light mist, grew heavier, each drop echoing his mounting despair.
Two hours into his vigil, the figure of Guido appeared. His friend stood next to him, huddled in his own jacket, his eyebrows raised in inquiry. &quot;No luck?&quot;
Evan lowered his gaze, his voice barely audible against the patter of the rain. &quot;No, I haven't seen her.&quot;
Guido clapped a hand on his shoulder, his gruff voice breaking through Evan's reverie. &quot;Sorry, bro. Don't stress it. There are plenty of fish in the sea.&quot;
Evan shook his head. &quot;I don't want to fish in the sea. She's the only one for me.&quot;
&quot;You ever consider, bro, that maybe she didn't show up because she has a boyfriend?&quot; Guido turned to Evan, a pragmatic expression etched on his face..
&quot;I just can't see it, Guido.&quot; Evan shook his head, his expression thoughtful.
&quot;You've said she's a stunner, right?&quot; Guido arched a questioning eyebrow.
Evan's eyes softened, his voice quiet. &quot;She transcends stunning. Her face... it's angelic.&quot;
&quot;Then isn't it possible some other dude's claimed that angel for himself?&quot; Guido pointed out, punctuating his words with a slight shrug.
&quot;I can't believe she would've kissed me if so. But there's something more...&quot; Evan's gaze drifted off, lost in memory. &quot;The way she looked at me, something in her eyes, it felt like... like she was meant to be mine.&quot;
Guido, bemused by Evan's impassioned response, ribbed him further. &quot;Man, what's so spectacular about this girl? She packin' triple D's or something?&quot;
Evan halted, throwing Guido a pointed look. His tone sharpened, &quot;Guido, knock it off. She's not just some random girl. She's exceptional. Show some respect, dude!&quot;
Guido raised his hands defensively, a grin still pulling at his lips. &quot;Alright, alright,&quot; he said, chuckling slightly. &quot;Didn't mean to ruffle your feathers. My bad.&quot; He stepped back slightly, folding his arms across his chest in a mock show of surrender, his fingers tapping a playful beat against his biceps. &quot;I don't get you, dude. You got women lined up to be with you, and you're stressing over a girl whose name you don't know? You should adopt my style – no strings attached, no drama.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, and no hope for love,&quot; Evan retorted, his voice heavy.
Guido chuckled again, but his tone was softer, almost affectionate. &quot;My friend, ever the hopeless romantic.&quot;
Evan sighed, frustration creeping into his voice. &quot;I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm just... I'm just...just…&quot; He trailed off, unable to find the words. After a moment, he added, &quot;I don't know what I am. I just know that I have to see my Cinderella again.&quot;
Guido patted his back again, a grin spreading across his face. &quot;Let's leave the matching glass slipper search for another day. Come on, let's head back to our place. We’ll knock down a few beers and watch baseball. The Cubs actually have a chance for the playoffs this year!&quot;
Guido's words seemed to echo in the void around Evan, but they didn't seem to stir him from his spot.
Guido persisted, &quot;You'll feel a lot better with a cold brew in your hand and a Cubs victory on the TV. I’ll tell you what, after the game, we’ll try to figure a way to get her name.&quot;
Still, Evan remained silent, a statue against the rain and gloom.
Guido's joking tone made a comeback, &quot;How hard can it be to find the most beautiful girl on campus?&quot;
That finally managed to pull a small smile from Evan. &quot;I suppose you're right. I'll bump into her sooner or later.&quot;
Guido nodded, giving Evan's shoulder one last squeeze. &quot;Exactly! Let's chill at home, and we’ll scour the Internet when the game is over.&quot;
&quot;Thanks, dude. I feel better already,&quot; Evan admitted, and with that, they turned their backs to the library and started the journey home</Text>

            <Notes>Certainly! If Evan doesn't want to come across as too harsh, he could respond more lightly, but still assert his point, such as:

Guido: &quot;Not to be a downer, bro, but have you considered that maybe she didn't show because she's seeing someone?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Not a chance, Guido.&quot;
Guido: &quot;Well, you keep saying she's a knock-out, right?&quot; 
Evan: &quot;Beyond a knock-out. She's ethereal.&quot;
Guido: &quot;Then what makes you think some other guy hasn't already claimed that ethereal beauty?&quot;
Evan: &quot;She wouldn't have kissed me if she was with someone else. And it's not just that. The way she looked at me, there was something in her eyes that told me she was interested in me, and only me.&quot;
Guido found himself surprised by the intensity of Evan's emotions. &quot;Man, what's so special about this girl? She's got some secret charm or something?&quot;
Evan halted, his gaze hardening as he looked at Guido, a sternness to his voice. &quot;Enough, Guido. She's not just 'this girl'. She's different, she's unique. Let's maintain some respect here, alright?&quot;

Guido: &quot;I hate to bring this up, but maybe she didn't show because she has a boyfriend.&quot;
Evan: &quot;No way dude.&quot;
Guido: &quot;You said she's beautiful, didn't you?&quot; 
Evan: &quot;She's been on beautiful. She has the face of an angel.&quot;
Guido: &quot;the why don't you think some dude snagged that Angel?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't think she would kissed me. But it's more than that. Something in her eyes, the way she looked at me said she was mine.&quot;
Guido had never witnessed Evan respond to a woman with such intensity. &quot;Dude, what's so great about this chick? She got three boobs or something?&quot;
Evan paused, glancing at Guido, a slight edge to his voice. &quot;Guido, that's enough, man. She's not just some girl. She's special. Let's keep it classy, okay?&quot;

            <Synopsis>Evan and Guido are playing Frisbee in the Quad. Evan decides to head to the library for extra study time to keep his grade point average above 3.0 – a promise he made to his sister Liz.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Quad at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign sprawled like a lush green carpet under the sun. Majestic oaks and maples lined its periphery, their leaves rustling softly in the gentle breeze. Students lounged on the grass, engrossed in their books or chatting animatedly in groups, while others meandered along the pathways. The sky was a canvas of vivid blue, and the sun painted everything with a golden hue. It was the kind of morning that infused the soul with energy, and the Quad pulsated with the vibrancy of college life.
&quot;Hey, Evan! Think fast!&quot; Guido shouted, sending the Frisbee soaring toward Evan with a wicked curve.
Evan moved effortlessly, intercepting the disc with a graceful leap. &quot;Man, you're getting rusty!&quot; he called out, his voice dripping with mock derision.
Guido laughed, adjusting his cap. &quot;Maybe if you spent as much time on the field as you do in the library, you'd have a challenge here.&quot;
Evan smirked, &quot;Trying to get on Liz's good side, you know. A promise is a promise.&quot; He tossed the Frisbee back, his mind briefly flitting to his sister's encouraging smile. 
&quot;Ah, the great Evan Vaughn, tamed by a promise to his sister,&quot; Guido teased, catching the disc. &quot;You know, most guys are trying to escape the library, not run toward it.&quot;
Evan chuckled, picking up his backpack from the grass. &quot;She believes in me, man. I don't want to let her down. Besides,&quot; he winked, &quot;some of us need to hit the books to keep up. Not all of us have your natural... charm.&quot;
Guido feigned a dramatic gasp. &quot;I'll take that as a compliment.&quot; 
With a final laugh and wave, Evan began his departure from the Quad, energized by the day's perfection and a commitment he intended to honor. The playful banter with Guido still echoing in his mind, the path ahead felt light and hopeful.</Text>

            <Title>0121 Evan is a Man With a Plan</Title>
            <Text>Evan maneuvered his aged Subaru down the university streets, the compact SUV humming with the consistency only an old reliable car could offer. The sun painted a fresh coat of brightness over the day, streaks of light dancing on the dashboard, the weather reminiscent of the day he'd met Sarah. An energetic tune played from the radio, matching his cheerful demeanor. He found himself tapping along, humming the lyrics under his breath, the Cubs' three-game winning streak and yesterday's softball victory lending an extra beat to his rhythm. 
Guido had managed to coax him away from countless futile hours of scouring the Internet for his elusive mystery girl. And in retrospect, he realized that Guido was right; his image, drenched in the rain, desperate and waiting for a woman who might never show up, wasn't the kind of impression he wanted to give off. 
This morning, however, Evan woke with an idea burning bright in his mind. It was as if the universe had conspired overnight, offering him a hint, a spark of insight that felt like the missing piece of a complex puzzle. He'd remembered Sarah's scholarly attire, her intelligent aura. He'd realized she might be a bookworm. And where do bookworms hide? He laughed at the obviousness of it all. The library.
An air of confidence billowed around Evan, his chest swelled with newfound hope. He wasn't going to wait around, moping, and hoping for her appearance. If she wasn't at their first meeting spot, he'd plunge into the depths of the undergrad library, the refuge of bookworms and study enthusiasts. His gut feeling told him he'd find her there.
Pulling into a parking spot, Evan cut the engine, letting the last few notes of the energetic song fade. He opened the car door, a rush of early fall air filling his lungs, crisp with the promise of new beginnings. There was an excited skip to his step, an ease in his manner as he locked the vehicle and turned towards the library. His heart held no room for anxiety, only a serene confidence. He was a man with a plan. He felt like he was walking in stride with destiny itself, and it was impossible not to share in his assurance. With one last deep breath, he set off, ready to conquer the day.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Katie’s hairdresser gives Sarah a makeover.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah and Katie found themselves pausing as they stepped into the expansive, cutting-edge apartment. The atmosphere was a harmonious blend of lavish extravagance and sophisticated minimalism, reflected in the streamlined furniture and immaculate spaces. Unimpeded by clutter, the stunning panorama from the floor-to-ceiling windows stood out prominently. Awestruck, Katie's gaze swept across the interiors, soaking up every exquisite detail.
&quot;Wow, this place is amazing! How many bedrooms are there?&quot; The question resonated in the expansive space.
&quot;Two,&quot; Sarah's response came as a quiet murmur.
&quot;Is your roommate home?&quot; Katie inquired, her visual exploration of the apartment ongoing.
Sarah negated with a shake of her head. &quot;I don’t have a roommate. It’s just me.&quot;
Katie's eyes widened in surprise. &quot;No roommate? You must be rich.&quot;
&quot;My father is,&quot; Sarah shrugged. &quot;He owns a large corporation. He wanted me to have an extra bedroom that I could use as an office. I usually work at the dining room table, or in my bedroom.&quot;
The idea of privacy, the luxury of space, left Katie yearning. &quot;I can’t even imagine what it’s like not to have to share a room. It makes it impossible to study.&quot;
A silence settled between them, dense and tangible. Sarah watched as Katie's gaze took another spin around the room before she extended a friendly hand. &quot;If you like, you can use my place if you need to study for a big test or just need some quiet time.&quot;
&quot;Really! Thank you!&quot; With those words, Katie lunged forward and gave Sarah a big hug, the latter taken by surprise but welcoming the warmth.
Katie broke the hug, her eyes twinkling with an idea. &quot;I scheduled an appointment with my stylist. She asked me to send a picture, so she can get an idea of what she might want to do.&quot;
Katie asked, “So, tell me about the guy you’re dating tonight. What’s his name? How did you meet?&quot;
Sarah's features softened and brightened at the mention of Evan. &quot;His name is Evan. He saved me from falling on some steps. I don’t know what came over me, but the way he looked at me and told me he wanted to kiss me... I couldn’t help myself.&quot;
&quot;So, did you kiss?&quot; Katie asked, her face lighting up.
A small smile adorned Sarah's lips. &quot;Yes, we did! Katie, I’ve never experienced anything like that. It was like this other version of myself took over my body, and it felt incredible. My body was vibrating for hours afterward. Evan said the universe meant for us to meet like that.&quot;
Katie's exclamation of delight filled the room as she clapped her hands together. Her admiration for the romantic gesture was palpable. 
As Katie was about to open her mouth to dive into another subject, the familiar buzz of her cell phone diverted her attention. She quickly glanced at the screen, her eyebrows arching slightly. &quot;Oh, it's Nicole, my hairstylist,&quot; she explained. &quot;She wants to confirm our appointment and she needs a picture of you to start making a plan for your makeover.&quot;
Sarah blinked in surprise but then smiled in response. &quot;Alright, let's do it.&quot;
Katie quickly captured a picture of Sarah, her fingers flying over the phone as she sent the image to Nicole. Within moments, Nicole responded with a flurry of excited emojis, already expressing her eagerness to work on Sarah's transformation. 
Katie asked, &quot;So altogether, including new clothes and hairstylist, what kind of budget are we talking?&quot; 
&quot;No budget constraints, you're in charge!&quot; Sarah said with a playful grin.
Katie's eyes lit up at this and she squealed, clapping her hands in excitement. &quot;Really? Oh, this is going to be so much fun!&quot;
The energy in the room was effervescent, reflecting off Sarah as her own excitement began to bubble up. It was new, this anticipation of a date, of being made over, of possibly breaking her own rules, but it was an invigorating feeling that Sarah welcomed.
Katie, full of curiosity, veered the conversation towards Sarah's dating past. &quot;You said it had been a while since you dated?&quot; She was already conjuring up different makeovers in her mind, ready to transform Sarah for her date.
Sarah grinned, a surprising lightness in her tone. &quot;I haven’t dated since I was 16.&quot;
&quot;16? Wowza!&quot; Katie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. But she wasn't done probing, her next question laced with a touch of delicacy. &quot;If you don’t mind me asking, are you a...&quot; She paused, &quot;virgin?&quot;
&quot;No, I’m not a virgin,&quot; Sarah confessed, the hesitation barely noticeable. &quot;I experimented for a short time in high school, but I didn't see what was so great about it.&quot;
Katie leaned in closer, her voice a comforting whisper. &quot;It will be way different when you find the right guy.” 
A mischievous twinkle lit up in Sarah's eyes, an expression that silently echoed, &quot;Maybe!?&quot; This was a different Sarah, one who was open to the possibility of something more, something exciting, something like... Evan.
Seizing the moment, Katie ventured to ask, &quot;Do you think Evan may be the right guy?&quot;
The response was immediate, Sarah's smile reaching her eyes as she raised her eyebrows. &quot;He's the right guy if he makes love even half as good as he kisses!&quot; 

Their giggles echoed around the room, the atmosphere brimming with anticipation and the sheer joy of newfound possibilities. The girls were truly ready for a night that promised to be a roller coaster of emotions and revelations.
Katie's head tilted slightly, a silent question in her eyes. The puzzle of how a date came to be from a runner's flight was intriguing. Sarah's words offered the missing piece; Evan had sought her out in the library, persistent and charming. Despite her best attempts to stay true to her policy, she found herself succumbing to the magnetic pull of Evan's appeal.
A knowing smile danced on Katie's lips as she watched Sarah's face transform, a touch of red gracing her cheeks. It was evident; the rule, the policy Sarah had held on to so firmly, had been fractured. A spark of defiance lit up in her eyes, an implicit admission of breaking her no-dating policy.
Katie's features softened into a warm, knowing smile. &quot;So you decided to step beyond your no-dating policy?&quot; Her tone carried no judgment; instead, it was rich with approval, almost as if she had been waiting for Sarah to allow herself this freedom.
Sarah shrugged, a hint of sheepishness creeping into her features. &quot;I didn’t have a choice. Every time he kisses me, I can’t think straight. Since the moment I met him, I haven’t been able to study or focus on anything. All I think about is him. Maybe this date will help clear my mind.&quot;
&quot;Are you worried this might develop into something more?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes glinting with mischief.
&quot;I have thought a lot about that. If I could find a way to have a relationship with Evan without being distracted from my work, I would like that. The thought of having someone by my side when attending an event or someone to hang out with here at home, appeals to me. But, I have a feeling it’s not going to be that simple.&quot;
Katie nodded, taking in Sarah's words. &quot;Well, if you ask me, I think you are doing the right thing. You can't let your studies keep you from living your life. There is always a way to make things work. You just have to find your balance.&quot;

Let's expand and animate this part of the scene. I can see Katie awestruck in real life when she walks into a luxury apartment, but to Sarah, it's commonplace. 
While Katie pauses and marvels at this place, maybe walks to the window and looks out the window, Sarah would likely veer off in a separate direction to her kitchen and get something to drink – perhaps wine or coffee or water. In contrast to Sarah, Katie might tell Sarah how great the department is, maybe how incredible the view is. Sarah might offer her something to drink, as anyone would when a new guest comes to their apartment. 
Have Katie accept the drink, and then have Sarah tell Katie to have a seat on her couch. Sarah can then bring her drink to her, sit down and start their chat.
Here are a couple of things to note as you rebuild the first part of this scene. Champaign, Illinois is a small town, so there won't be any extensive city views. If you describe the view out the window, let's have Sarah's apartment look out into an expansive preservation area—lots of trees and greenery with a small appealing creek running through the nature preserve.
I want to start the scene with the reader feeling like there with Sarah and Katie. Right now, it feels like they're just two people talking anywhere. I want to immerse the reader into the scene.
Please rewrite and expand that first paragraph if that's enough to work with. If you need more information, let me know. Were brainstorming here, you have free reign to express your thoughts and ideas.</Notes>

            <Text>For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, their first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is underway. They've never met, as their social circles don't intersect. Evan, a charismatic, athletic young man, commands popularity not by choice but by virtue of his outgoing personality. Despite his natural allure, he remains grounded thanks to the guidance from his saintly sister, Liz, treating everyone with kindness.
Evan isn't the most diligent student, preferring the outdoors to the confines of classrooms and libraries. However, to uphold a promise to Liz, he's striving for a minimum GPA of 3.0. As he enters his senior year, his grades are teetering on this threshold, and he is compelled to trade Frisbee games for study sessions at the undergrad library.
Contrastingly, Sarah is a stellar student, poised to graduate at the top of her class. As a business major and teaching assistant, she considers the library her sanctuary, often losing herself in riveting audio seminars, like one on international business strategies. One day, engrossed in her seminar, she realizes she's running late for a class she's teaching. In her rush, she neglects her surroundings and dashes towards a flight of stairs without a handrail.
Evan, heading her way, spots the impending accident. He calls out to her, but she doesn't hear him. He dashes to intercept her before she reaches the stairs, catching her just in time. This unexpected encounter leads to a spontaneous, passionate kiss. 
Sarah, brought up with a single-minded focus on academics and preparing to take over her father's business, has little experience with romance. She had sworn off any romantic entanglements until she completed her Master’s degree and embarked on her professional journey. 
In a whirlwind, Sarah leaves without providing Evan her name or contact. Later, Evan manages to track her down, returning a pair of glasses she had left behind and charming her into taking a break at the food court. Despite her initial hesitation, she gives in to Evan’s allure. 
Their encounter at the food court leaves Sarah questioning herself as she witnesses Evan’s popularity, especially among the female students. Feeling out of place, she retreats, but Evan convinces her to agree to a date. Uncertain about dating norms, Sarah enlists the help of one of her top students, Katie, to modernize her look and prep her for the date. 
During their date, Sarah proposes a business-like arrangement with Evan, setting rules and expectations and prioritizing her academics. Evan, who has been smitten since their first encounter, happily agrees. As they continue to see each other, Sarah allows herself to experience romance and affection, while Evan becomes a better student with Sarah’s help. 
Their senior year unfolds beautifully. Sarah expands her social circle, and Evan lands a good job in Chicago. As graduation approaches, however, Sarah grapples with her future choices – Ivy League schools for her Master's or staying with Evan. Unbeknownst to her, Evan plans to propose at the graduation party, inviting her parents for the surprise.
Sarah, who has downplayed the seriousness of their relationship to her parents, is taken aback by Evan’s proposal. She fears disappointing her father by deviating from her initial plan. Following the party, her father presents her with two choices – follow Evan to Chicago and build a life there, or stick to the original plan of pursuing her Master's and eventually joining her father’s business. If she chooses Evan, her father will cut off financial support.
Sarah is torn between her love for Evan and her commitment to her father. Despite the complexities, her heart prevails, and she chooses to build a life with Evan in Chicago. Sarah and Evan elope. 
While all indications are the happy couple is excited and ready to start a life together, all may not be as it seems.
After a quick marriage ceremony, and Sarah and Evan are officially married, Sarah retreats to the lady’s restroom. Stonefaced, she stares at herself in the mirror and asks herself, &quot;Oh my god. What have I done!?&quot;</Text>

Scene Name: 0160 Sarah &amp; Evan’s First Date
Characters: Sarah, Evan
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Thai Garden Restaurant
Setting: Tucked away in the heart of a vibrant central Illinois lies an unassuming, yet undeniably modern hair salon. Through the large glass facade, the salon's chic and bustling atmosphere beckons to both casual passersby and dedicated customers alike.
Upon crossing the threshold, visitors are met with an airy, open space, replete with the gentle hum of hairdryers, the soft rustle of foil, and the low murmur of friendly conversation. The flooring is a modern marvel, laid out with sleek, polished wooden planks that lend a warm, contemporary touch to the space.
To the right of the entrance, an intimate seating area is neatly arranged. An elegant, tufted couch in a muted gray is flanked by a pair of sleek armchairs. Placed strategically, this area allows Katie to comfortably observe the transformation process
Tone: Exciting, hopeful, anticipatory, friendly
Weather: Partly cloudy and nice outside.
Special Instructions: 
Use the provided scene verbatim, excluding embedded instructions. Adapt and incorporate embedded instructions into the scene as seamlessly as possible while maintaining the original dialogue and narration.
Use the narrative to enhance the existing dialogue, emphasizing character emotions, internal thoughts, and the setting as necessary. However, ensure the dialogue remains the central mechanism for moving the plot forward.
Integrate dialogue tags an action tags at your full discretion. 
Remove all speaker labels identified by the character name followed by a colon and a space. Example &quot;Sarah: &quot;
In this heavy dialogue, keep the characters moving, doing something with their hands – some sort of background activity to keep the scene flowing. I always want my readers to feel like there in the scene, not watching the scene.
Character Arcs for This Scene: 
Sarah:  Sarah was intent on not making any decisions based on emotion. She came ready to go with the plan that she thought would be a win-win for both of them. 
It never occurred to her, one way or another, how Evan would respond to her contract negotiation approach. Because to her that was a very normal natural way to handle the situation. 
Like her father taught her, Sarah took control of the negotiations and, in her mind, keep control. While she was thinking Evan was going to negotiate with her, Evan was just amused by the whole thing. There was just something about Sarah that Evan found so unique and so adorable.
Sarah was thrown off guard when Evan did not counter her proposal. She never did seem to understand that, he just wants to be with her. All that other stuff that she's worried about doesn't matter at all to him.
While Sarah started the date with the business mindset. As soon as Evan agrees, the energy of the night changes. Now she can relax and just embrace a relationship with Evan. 
As will find out in the next scene, the date ends not like business negotiation, but in full romance and sentimentality. Leaving even Sarah shedding happy tears. Which shocks her to her core. But, at least for this night, for the first time she feels like a normal woman. A feeling she never wanted to feel like before, but now feels better than anything she's ever felt.
However, in this scene we only get a hint of that at the end. 
Evan: Evan's Mark is fairly simple for this scene. Evan &quot;is all&quot; in before Sarah even gets there. He's smitten with her and there is not much she could say that would dissuade him. 
Throughout the dinner Evan is Evan. He liked to joke a lot, he likes to complement Sarah, he treats her well. He adores every word that comes out of her mouth.
This would be true no matter what she said. However, Evan actually loves Sarah's approach to this state. He always felt that the whole courtship process was fake. People would treat each other nice until they got what they wanted and they would start taking each other for granted.
While Sarah's business-style contract negotiation approach to starting a relationship would send most men running for the hills. Evan thinks it's a great idea.
Starting a relationship on the same page. Skipping the whole fake recording process. Instead, just lay everything on the table at the beginning. He wondered why our relationships shouldn't start this way. 
He starts the date ready to be in relationship with Sarah, and ends the date glad that he's in a relationship with Sarah. 
Draft Scene:
[[This is the one and only time that this location will be the setting in the story. Whenever I introduce a new location, I like to start the scene off with a description as the characters enter the scene. Use the &quot;Setting: &quot; marker in this template for a detailed description.]]
[[Sarah stood outside the Thai Garden Restaurant on Kirby Avenue. Through the window, she could see Evan texting on his phone. Sarah felt terrified. Sarah was used to controlling her emotions and actions, yet here she was, feeling incapable of walking away and maintaining her no dating policy. However, even an emotional Sarah was never truly out of control. She came with a well-thought-out plan.
Evan waited anxiously, trying to find someone to text to help pass the time. He felt a presence over his shoulder and looked up, then look back to his phone. A second later, he looked back again, realizing it was Sarah.]]
 [[ Seeing it was Sarah brought a smile to his face. Evan stood up, kissed Sarah. ]]
Evan: “I almost didn’t recognize you. Did you do all this for me?” 
[[ Referring to her makeover. ]]
Sarah: “I was in the mood to change things up a bit.”
Evan: “Looking for a change, are you? I hope that bodes well for me.”
Sarah: [[Sarah moved her eyes up and to the right, donned a sly grin]] “We’ll see.”
Evan: [[Evan laughed.]] “Let’s go eat!”
Sarah: [[When they got to the table, Evan pulled out the seat for Sarah.]] “Thank you. You are quite the gentleman.”
Evan: “You look great! But you know you’d didn’t have to change anything for me. You are beautiful now, you're just as beautiful as when I first laid eyes on you.”
“Server:” [[Their server appeared just as Evan finished his complement.]] “Welcome to the Thai Garden. May I start you off with something to drink?”
Sarah: “I'll have a glass of Pinot Noir’.”
Evan: “Make that two.&quot; 
[[Sarah and Evan took a few minutes to discuss the menu and were ready to order when their server returned. Evan went with the Spicy Pad Thai, and Sarah settled on the Kao Pai.]]
Evan: “I was worried you wouldn’t show up.&quot;
Sarah: “I told you I always keep my appointments.&quot;
Evan: “I was hoping you would think of this as a date and not an appointment.”
Sarah: “Sorry, poor choice of words. Why don’t we start this date off with you telling me a little about yourself?” 
Evan: “Fair enough. I’m a pretty simple guy. I work as a personal trainer at the gym down the street. I like to play sports, hike, run, bike, anything that gets me outside. I enjoy hanging out with my friends. Anything else you want to know?”
Sarah: “What’s your major? Are you a good student?”
Evan: “I’m majoring in software development with a minor in marketing. I guess I’m a good student when I apply myself. At least, that’s what my sister would say. I don’t enjoy being cooped up in a classroom, but I promised her I would maintain a decent GPA. That's how I met you. I was heading to the library to study to maintain my GPA.”
Sarah: “Are you close to your sister?” 
Evan: “Yes, but right now, she’s in Chicago, so I don’t get to see her as often as I like. That’s where I’m from. How about you? What’s your story? Where are you from?
Sarah: “I grew up in Seattle, no siblings. I’m a business major with a focus on international trade, a teacher’s assistant, and I'm in the running for graduating at the top of our class.
“If you don’t mind me asking, I get the impression that you could’ve gone to any university you wanted to. Why would you pick the University of Illinois?”
Sarah: “My father owns a multimillion-dollar corporation. He was a self-made man from modest beginnings. He and my mother went to U of I, and our agreement was I would follow in his footsteps, get my Bachelor’s degree here. After graduation, I plan to attend a prestigious East Coast University for my master’s degree.
This plan has the extra benefit of making new contacts in the Midwest and the East Coast. My father stresses how important it is to make as many business contacts as possible.”
Evan: “Are you going to work with him after you get your master’s degree?”
Sarah: “Not right away. The idea is to gain experience with a large international corporation, and then in 5 to 7 years, join my father’s company in an executive position. By the time he is ready to retire, I should have enough experience to take over as CEO.”
Evan: “That’s very interesting. Do you have a job?”
[[Their food arrived, pausing the conversation.]]
Sarah: “This food looks and smells delicious!” [[Sarah took a bite.]] “It even tastes better than it looks. Excellent choice of restaurants!”
Evan: “I don’t get to come here very often, but I love their food.&quot; 
[[Evan said as he ate his meal.]]
 Sarah: [[continued their conversation]] “I don’t have a paying job, but I do volunteer as an events coordinator for various nonprofit organizations in the area. During summer breaks, I stay in Chicago and volunteer there.”
Evan: “That’s admirable.”
Sarah: “My father also stresses the importance of philanthropic work. He says it’s good to give back to the community and a great way to meet other like-minded people.”
Evan: “That makes sense. What do you do for fun?”
Sarah: “I do nothing for fun per se. However, I go to a lot of business socials, fundraisers, and academic seminars.”
Evan: “Let me guess. So you can make more contacts!”
Sarah: “You find me one-dimensional, don’t you?”
Evan: “I'm quite impressed with what you have told me. I like the idea of getting involved with non-profit organizations. It just seems like you should allow some time for fun.”
Sarah:: [[ grinned and reminded Evan ]] “I’m here with you, aren’t I?” 
Evan: “Yes, you are! I'm happy about that.”
[[As they continued to eat, Evan and Sarah chitchatted about a variety of subjects. The conversation flowed well, and Sarah surmised Evan was more intelligent than she might have given him credit for. She determined he would make a quality companion and convinced herself it was based on analysis and not physical or emotional attraction.
Sarah ordered a small espresso, while Evan ordered a piece of cheesecake for dessert. Sarah shared her thoughts while Evan ate his dessert.]]
Sarah: “I was wondering if I could make a proposal?”
Evan: “A proposal already? We just met.&quot; joked Evan. “Go ahead; I’m all ears.”
 Sarah: “Since I met you, I have been reconsidering my thoughts on relationships. A relationship is a partnership. I wanted to propose that we form a partnership. In business, it is essential to identify all foreseeable issues before signing an agreement.
“My father taught me it is best to lead with what I have to offer first, and here is what I can provide to this partnership. I can teach you some study techniques to improve your grades with minimal effort. As a romantic partner, I can already tell you’re going to want me to break out of my shell and socialize with your friends and others in my age group. I can’t promise that I'll attend every party or social event, but I'll accompany you as often as I can, and if there is a particular event that is important to you, I’ll try to attend.
“As adults in a romantic relationship, I expect there will be some physical intimacy involved. I want to be honest with you here. I'm not a virgin, but I'm also not very experienced. I haven't been on a date since I was 16 years old.
“You are quite attractive, and I'm interested in pursuing a physical relationship. I'll need you to be patient, as I explore that aspect of myself. I expect you to wait until I'm ready.”
Evan interrupted. “May I ask a question?” [[Sarah nodded, and Evan continued]], “I play softball every Sunday morning. Will you be able to come to my games?”
Sarah: “My schedule is usually clear on Sunday mornings. I should be able to make it to many of your games.”
Evan: [[Having Sarah at his games was an important point for Evan, evidenced by the excited look on his face.]]  “Continue with your proposal.”
Sarah: [[continued]] “The most important thing to me is that you understand my academic career comes first. That means no pressuring me to go to parties or spend time together until after I’ve attended to my studies.
“I attend a lot of formal events. Just as I'll attend your social events, I shall expect the same in return. Keep in mind these aren’t frat parties.”
Evan: “Is that what you think I'm, a frat boy?”
Sarah: “I didn’t mean to imply that. I just want to let you know you may have to dress up for some of these events. These events will also be a great way for you to make contacts. The more contacts you have, the better chance you will get the job you want when you graduate.”
Evan: “Here we go again with the contacts.&quot;
Sarah: “It’s not just that. I like you. It would honor me to have you by my side at any event. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you since the moment you kissed me. If we let our relationship develop organically, I may never regain my focus.”
Evan: “I feel the same. You’ve been the only thing on my mind for the last week. I can’t focus any better than you can. There’s something about you that is just so different and so special. It’s like somehow, I already know it’s going to work out. There’s nothing I want more than to bypass the whole dating phase and call you my girlfriend.”
Sarah: “That’s my proposal then. Do you have a counter-proposal?” 
[[Evan had no problem with Sarah’s less than romantic offer and voiced his approval.]]
Evan:  “No counter-proposal. I’m in total agreement!”
Sarah: [[laughed]] “My father said if they accept your first offer, you offered too much.”
Evan: “Look at it from my point of view. You said you would attend my games, you plan to explore your sexuality with me when you’re ready, you are going to hook me up with potential employers, and you can help me get good grades, which will make my sister happy. What more could I ask for?”
[[Sarah put out her hand for a handshake.]] 
Sarah: “So we have a deal?”
Evan: “No way are we sealing this deal with a handshake.&quot;
[[What Evan is implying, not so subtly, is that it's time to leave the restaurant because he wants to seal the deal with a kiss.]]
[[He called for the check, paid it, and escorted Sarah out of the restaurant.]]

            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0132 Sarah Relents and agrees to a date
Characters: Evan, Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Locations: Outside on the campus of the University of Illinois, somewhere between the food court and the parking lot.
Time of Day: Morning
Tone: Sweet, funny, intriguing, exciting, frantic. The scene has a bit of all emotion.
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
This scene is essential because it shows Evan is more than muscles, lips, and charm. When Sarah makes yet another attempt to escape, and this time Evan stops her, they finally have a chance to talk.
Sarah is used to being the smartest person in the room, even amongst adults older than her. That being said, this shows that Evan can hold his own in a conversation with her. 
At first, Sarah's disoriented by Evan's ability to communicate with her so intelligently. Sarah found herself more attracted to Evan with every word he said. 
This may be very subtle in this scene, but Sarah begins to see that she could have a relationship with someone like Evan. Evan is someone not afraid to challenge her. She was impressed by how Evan was not intimidated by her IQ or GPA. 
But more than that, she felt herself changing in real time as she spoke to him. He brought a softer side out in her. He got her to think outside of her rigid box – thinking in ways she had never thought before.
If possible, or once they start talking outside the food court, see if you can build the attraction momentum as she becomes more and more attracted to him. Although she still resists. The attraction building is as much intellectual as it is physical. Sarah could have resisted Evan if the attraction was merely physical. The way to Sarah's heart is through her mind.
I've included a rough first draft. Here are a few items I need help with:
Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. I'm particularly interested in maintaining the authentic voice of my characters and the specific flow of the conversation.
What I like about this scene is how it escalates the scene before. In the prior scenes, Evan gets Sarah to agree to a 15-minute break. Now he gets her to agree to a date. As the scenes move forward, he successfully whittles away her resistance.
I like how this scene has multiple emotions. Try keeping those in the scene as much as possible.
There is no need for any full upfront vivid detail of the location/setting, but feel free to integrate into this heavy dialogue scene as needed. There outside on a breezy warm sunny day.
Remove all &quot;Evan:&quot; and &quot;Sarah:&quot; labels. Feel free to insert, modify, or remove dialogue tags and action tags at your discretion. Remember that I would like the dialogue to stay intact as much as possible.
Sequence of Events:
Evan: “Where are you going?” 
Evan was intent on not letting her get away again. He chased after her. 
Evan called her, “Hey, Cinderella, wait up, wait up!” before catching up with her.
She stopped and turned to him. “Why do you call me Cinderella?”
“Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”
“Why do you keep pursuing me? It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.” 
“I want to learn more about you. What’s wrong with that?”
“It doesn’t take a genius to see that we exist in different worlds.”
Evan laughed. “Let me guess. You’re a genius?”
“I do have a genius IQ, but that’s not my point.”
“What is your point?” he asked.
“As a couple, we make little sense. I came to college to get an education and network with professionals to further my academic and professional careers. I committed to focusing on my work and refraining from distracting relationships. You don’t need me. You must know every female on campus.”
Evan smiled. “Are you jealous? You have nothing to worry about.”
&quot;I’m not jealous. I simply can’t understand why you’re focusing your attention on me.&quot; Sarah asked, her arms crossed as she faced him, her eyes brimming with questions.
Evan looked at her, his eyes reflecting a mix of curiosity and genuine interest. &quot;I don't know, Sarah. There's just something about you. You're different from the girls I'm used to meeting.&quot;
&quot;You don't even know me,&quot; she countered, her voice softer than intended, her gaze shifting to the ground.
He nodded, acknowledging her point. &quot;That's true,&quot; he admitted, a breeze lifting a lock of his hair as he met her gaze again. &quot;But let me ask you something. Why did you kiss me? Why are you here with me now instead of studying?&quot;
She dropped her gaze to her feet, her foot tracing an absent pattern on the pavement. &quot;Other than the obvious…&quot; she began, implying Evan's good looks. Her voice tapered off to a whisper, &quot;I don't know either.&quot;
A persuasive plea etched in Evan's eyes as he stepped closer to her, the distance between them shrinking. &quot;Well, let's find out together,&quot; he said earnestly, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Go to dinner with me.”
Sarah remained silent, not ready to surrender, not prepared to escape.
Evan continued, “I understand the importance of education, but college is more than classes and exams. It’s about relationships, having fun, trying new things.”
“I promised my Father that typical college hijinks would not distract me.”
“Did your Father ask you not to build meaningful relationships?”
“No, not exactly. He advised me to stay focused.”
“Do you think he doesn’t want you to enjoy your college experience?”
“Of course, I don’t think that. He does say how important it is to be a well-rounded individual. But Evan, I made a plan that makes sense and has held to it for three years.”
“Doesn’t it make sense to enjoy your college life? Doesn’t it make sense, as you say, to be well-rounded? If so, doesn’t it make sense to pursue new relationships?”
Sarah was exasperated. She wasn’t used to someone challenging her perspective so effectively. “You have got my head spinning. It doesn’t help that every time you kiss me, my IQ drops 50 points. How can my plan make so much sense, yet your completely opposite approach makes sense too?”
“How can a piece of paper be both thin and wide?”
That statement made her think long enough for Evan to kiss her again.
He said, “I don’t work Thursday. Let’s have dinner away from campus. Do you like Thai food? The Thai Garden is a great place. It’s too expensive for your average college crowd, but it won’t break the bank. Thursday night, dinner at seven? It’s just one date. Let’s get to know each other.”
“Alright, I will meet you there at 7:30.”
Evan smacked his hand together. “That’s awesome! Can I get your phone number? Your Last Name?”
Sarah still had mixed feelings. “Let’s wait and see how it goes.”
“Do you have any plans now?”
“I am going to drive home and try to get some work done,” said Sarah.
Evan held out his hand. “May I walk you to your car?” 
Her breath returned to normal as she became more comfortable holding hands in public. When they got to her car, Evan asked, “May I get a kiss goodbye?”
“Of Course!”
After not being kissed for five years, she couldn’t get enough of Evan’s kisses. After a long make-out session, Evan asked, “How’s that IQ doing?”
Sarah made a rare joke, “2+2 equals 10.”
They laughed together as if it was the funniest joke ever told.
Evan said, “I’m afraid to let you go. I’m worried you won’t show up on Thursday.” 
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. I never break an appointment unless it’s an emergency.”</Text>

            <Text>Sarah's steps were brisk against the sidewalk, but she wasn't quick enough. She heard Evan calling out behind her, his tone playfully admonishing, &quot;Hey, Cinderella, wait up!&quot;
Turning back, she faced him, perplexed. &quot;Why do you call me Cinderella?&quot;
Evan's easy smile danced in the sunlight, his eyes bright with humor. &quot;Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”
&quot;And why are you so adamant about chasing after me?&quot; she countered. &quot;It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.&quot;
Evan stated, standing tall. &quot;I want to learn more about you. What’s wrong with that?”
&quot;It doesn’t take a genius to see that we exist in different worlds,” Sarah said with a huff.
His laughter was unexpected. “Let me guess. You’re a genius?”
“That’s not my point.”
Evan tilted his head, patient. “Then what is your point?”
“As a couple, we make little sense. I came to college to get an education and network with professionals to further my academic and professional careers. I committed to focusing on my work and refraining from distracting relationships. You don’t need me. You must know every female on campus.”
Evan smiled. “Are you jealous? You have nothing to worry about.”
&quot;I’m not jealous. I simply can’t understand why you’re focusing your attention on me.&quot; Sarah asked, her arms crossed as she faced him, her eyes brimming with questions.
Evan looked at her, his eyes reflecting a mix of curiosity and genuine interest. &quot;I don't know, Sarah. There's just something about you. You're different from the girls I'm used to meeting.&quot;
&quot;You don't even know me,&quot; she countered, her voice softer than intended, her gaze shifting to the ground.
He nodded, acknowledging her point. &quot;That's true,&quot; he admitted, a breeze lifting a lock of his hair as he met her gaze again. &quot;But let me ask you something. Why did you kiss me? Why are you here with me now instead of studying?&quot;
She dropped her gaze to her feet, her foot tracing an absent pattern on the pavement. &quot;Other than the obvious…&quot; she began, implying Evan's good looks. Her voice tapered off to a whisper, &quot;I don't know either.&quot;
A persuasive plea etched in Evan's eyes as he stepped closer to her, the distance between them shrinking. &quot;Well, let's find out together,&quot; he said earnestly, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Go to dinner with me.”
She was silent. Then, when the silence had stretched too long, Evan added, “College is about relationships, having fun, trying new things.”
“Doesn’t it make sense to enjoy your college life? To be well-rounded? To pursue new relationships?”
Sarah was exasperated. She wasn’t used to someone challenging her perspective so effectively. “You’ve got my head spinning. It doesn’t help that every time you kiss me, my IQ drops 50 points. How can my plan make so much sense, yet your completely opposite approach makes sense too?”
His next words caught her off guard. &quot;How can a piece of paper be both thin and wide?”
Before she could formulate an answer, Evan leaned in to kiss her again.
The taste of his kiss was sweet and confusing. Pulling back, Evan proposed again. “Thursday night, dinner at seven at the Thai Garden?&quot;
After a moment of hesitance, she relented. &quot;Alright, I will meet you there at seven.”
Evan's joy was infectious as he clapped his hands together. “That’s awesome! Can I get your phone number? Your last name?”
&quot;Let’s wait and see how it goes,&quot; Sarah replied cautiously.
He nodded, accepting her boundaries. As she turned to leave, he extended his hand. “May I walk you to your car?”
They walked hand in hand, and when they reached her car, Evan leaned in, hopeful. “May I get a kiss goodbye?”
“Of course.” She echoed his earlier words, her breath steadier now.
The kiss was long and tender, filled with promises of the potential for something more. Pulling away, Evan teased, “How’s that IQ doing?”
Sarah responded with an unusual attempt at humor. “2+2 equals 10.”
Laughter filled the air, a comforting and intimate sound. When it finally faded, Evan's eyes held a hint of concern. “I’m afraid to let you go. I’m worried you won’t show up on Thursday.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. I never break an appointment unless it’s an emergency.” Sarah's voice was steady, and Evan could see the resolve in her eyes, a promise of the adventure to come.</Text>

            <Title>0100 Everything is on Track for Sarah-1</Title>
            <Synopsis>In the unique setting of an underground library, Sarah Wilkins loses track of time while engrossed in an audio seminar. Realizing she's late for teaching her Business-101 class, she quickly packs her belongings and rushes toward the library's exit, her seminar still playing in her ears. The scene ends as she reaches the stairs, setting the stage for a chain of unforeseen events.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The underground undergrad library, a hidden sanctuary beneath the bustling campus of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, housed a wealth of knowledge within its hallowed walls. It was a place where students sought refuge from the world above, diving into a sea of books, papers, and digital resources. One corner of the library was adorned with historical plaques, recounting the rich history of the university and its significance in agricultural research. Among these, the Morrow Plots, the oldest experimental cornfields in the world, stood as a testament to the university's enduring commitment to learning and growth.
On this perfect day, the sun's warm rays filtered through the windows, casting a soft glow upon the students immersed in their studies. Among them was Sarah Wilkins, a driven and ambitious business major with a passion for international commerce. Her focused gaze fixated on her laptop screen, where an audio seminar on expanding business internationally played through her earbuds. It was a riveting discourse, and she couldn't help but hang on to every word, her desire for knowledge fueling her dedication.
Unbeknownst to her, time was slipping away like grains of sand in an hourglass. Sarah's role as a teacher's assistant required her to teach a Business-101 class to eager first-year students, a responsibility she took seriously. However, in her engrossment with the seminar, she lost track of time and risked being late for the very class she was supposed to lead.
The realization hit her like a bolt of lightning, causing her heart to race in panic. Hastily, she gathered her belongings from the study table, ensuring she didn't leave anything behind. The earbuds remained snugly nestled in her ears, playing the final few minutes of the seminar that held her captive.
With every step, the urgency to reach her class on time intensified. Sarah wanted to catch every last word of the audio seminar, unwilling to sacrifice any valuable insights. Her determination propelled her forward as she navigated the labyrinthine corridors of the underground library.
Ascending the stairs that led to the library's exit, Sarah's mind was singularly focused on her seminar, unaware of the world around her. The library, known for its tranquil ambiance, seemed like a mere backdrop to the knowledge she sought.
As she ascended the stairs, the sounds of the library started to fade behind her. The footsteps of other students, the hushed whispers, and the soft rustling of pages were gradually replaced by the distant hum of the world above.
Yet, unbeknownst to Sarah, fate had something in store for her. Beyond the confines of the library, an unforeseen encounter awaited her, one that would alter the course of her day, her semester, and perhaps even her life.
The scene ends here, leaving the readers hanging in suspense as Sarah's journey continues towards the library exit, her earbuds still tightly in place, oblivious to the impending twist of destiny.

            <Title>0116 Evan Hopes for Sarah's Return</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan stayed put, sitting on the stairs where he had just kissed the woman of his dreams. He hoped that she returned to the scene of the kiss. When she didn't show, he returned to the Quad to tell Guido all about what had just happened.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan stood just outside the entrance of the undergrad library, his heart still pounding from the kiss. He glanced down at the spectacles in his hand, a silent testament to the whirlwind event that had occurred just minutes prior. All thoughts of studying had fled; Sarah was the only subject matter on his mind now.
His feet began to trace the pathway to the Morrow Plots, almost on autopilot, as his mind played out the scenarios of Sarah returning. He visualized her surprise upon seeing him there, remembering their passionate kiss. The fantasy was tantalizing. He did not stray too far, lingering near the sight of their fateful encounter.
Evan paced, his eyes scanning the area for a hint of Sarah. One hour passed, then another. She did not return. Disappointment crept in, but with it came a renewed determination. He would mend her glasses, return to the same spot tomorrow. He hoped fate or Sarah's schedule would be consistent.
With his newfound resolution, Evan sought out his friend Guido, his steps carrying him toward The Quad. As expected, Guido was in the midst of his own adventure, attempting to charm two sophomore coeds. 
Yanking Guido away from his endeavor, Evan said, &quot;I gotta tell you something!&quot; His voice echoed his excitement. 
&quot;Why'd you do that?&quot; Guido protested, his bravado still on display. &quot;I had those two in the palm of my hand.&quot;
Ignoring Guido's typical exaggeration, Evan blurted out, &quot;I just kissed the most beautiful, amazing, wonderful woman in the world!&quot; 
Guido responded with skepticism, a hint of sarcasm edging his words. &quot;Sure you did.&quot;
Undeterred, Evan pressed on, relaying the entirety of his story, brandishing Sarah's glasses like a prized trophy. Guido laughed, his surprise echoing through The Quad. Seeing Sarah's glasses were broken, Guido said, &quot;That must've been one hell of a kiss!&quot;
&quot;It was!&quot; Evan's voice was soft, reverent. &quot;I think I will call her Cinderella. Instead of leaving a glass slipper, she left eyeglasses.&quot;
Guido raised an eyebrow, visibly taken aback. &quot;You kissed a girl seconds after meeting her? That's not like you, bro.&quot;
Evan shrugged, his face lighting up with the memory of the encounter. &quot;The Universe dropped her on my lap, and I had to go for it.&quot;
&quot;And now?&quot; Guido asked, ever the pragmatic.
&quot;I’m going to fix her glasses and try to find her tomorrow. Do you have an eyeglass repair kit?&quot;
Guido's gaze fell on Evan like he'd lost his mind. &quot;Sure, I got one in my back pocket,&quot; he quipped.
&quot;I should be able to find one at the mall. You want to come with?&quot; Evan asked.
&quot;Nah,&quot; Guido glanced across The Quad at a student reading on a blanket in the grass, &quot;I see a lonely lady over there that looks like she needs a visit from 'The Guido.’&quot;
And with that, they parted ways, Evan headed towards his car with a newfound mission and a heart brimming with anticipation. Despite the uncertainty of whether he would find Sarah the next day, he felt an unusual sense of excitement, like he was on the brink of something truly wonderful.</Text>

Special Instructions: 
In the sequence of events section, I provide some ideas of what might be done and spoke. You have full discretion to write this scene the way you feel works best.
Sequence of Events:
The scene begins in Evan's and Guido's apartment. 
They are late for work. Evan needs to be there in time because he has a client session scheduled at 6 o'clock – his schedule start time is personal trainer.
Guido doesn't have anything until seven. He's taking even more time than usual in the bathroom making sure every air is in place. There is a new female personal trainer that we do want to impress.
Evan is anxious because he does will be late for his client session. More importantly, he wants Guido hurry up so he can tell Guido all about his day with Sarah. He knows there's no point in telling Guido when Guido's admiring himself in the mirror.
It's Guido's turn to drive today. On the ride to the gym Evan relives his experience with Sarah.
Guido listens to his friend is best he can, but he is a little concerned how obsessed Evan is with this girl. Guido's never seen obsessed with any girl. 
Evan is begging Guido for ideas on how to make the date special. Guido looks at his family's crazy. 
Guido: “How what I know what special is? Special to me is I spend the night.”
Just starts naming things anyone would think of. Candy, Flowers, A bottle of wine, lingerie
Evan keeps shooting down for one reason or another. Either the gift is cliché and not special enough, or it's not appropriate for first date.
Eventually Guido gets irritated and says, &quot;I don't know dude you're asking the wrong guy. Get your act together dude, or she is going to ditch you 10 minutes into the date. You better play cool like ‘The Guido’”
Evan acknowledges that Guido has somewhat of a point. He is acting hyper enthusiastic. 
Guido said, &quot;Look bro, I'm glad you got a date with this girl. But from what I hear, he's a bit mature for her age.&quot; 
Evan asked what does that that even mean. 
Guido tells him it means she wants a cool sophisticated dude. You better get your act together before Thursday.
Guido continues. Rumor is she is some sort of high-class society girl that wouldn’t give the college the time of day. I hear she only dates older men–
Evan interrupted, that's not true–
Guido interrupts back. It doesn't matter dude. She's clearly not like the girls you I are used to hanging out with. If you want to get her something special, then you gotta realize what special her like a Gucci purse, or expensive shoes, or jewelry –
[[ Guido pulls into the gym ]]
[[Evan interrupts Guido after he says jewelry. ]]
That's it! You're a genius, dude.
[[Words Guido loves to hear]]
Guido asks what are you going to get her?
[[They get out of the car and head to the entrance of the gym]]
Evan says, I don't know. I'll go to the mall tomorrow and look for inspiration.

            <Title>Mary Higgins Clark</Title>
            <Text>In the sprawling campus of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the destinies of two distinct individuals, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, were dramatically intertwined. 
Evan Vaughn was the golden boy of the university, a charismatic senior with an appealing athletic build. Having been reared by his gentle sister Liz, he was known for his humility and respect towards everyone, regardless of their status. His performance in academics was unfortunately mediocre, not in line with his athletic prowess. Despite this, a promise made to his sister propelled him to strive for a 3.0 GPA, exchanging his leisurely times with his friend Guido for long hours in the library.
Sarah Wilkins, on the other hand, was an epitome of academic excellence. She carried the ambition to graduate as a class valedictorian. Libraries were her sanctuaries, where she would lose herself in intricate audio seminars and prepare for her teaching assistant role in a Business-101 class. Slated to take over her father's corporation, she was convinced that any romantic involvements should be put off until after her Master's degree.
Fate intervened when an absent-minded Sarah nearly stumbled down a flight of steps. It was Evan's quick instincts that saved her, their unexpected collision ending in a passionate, unexpected kiss. Sarah's glasses were left behind in the wake of her hasty retreat.
A few days later, Evan sought her out, bringing along her repaired glasses. Despite her initial reluctance, she found herself agreeing to a casual meeting in the food court. Amidst the throngs of people that flocked around Evan, Sarah's insecurities surfaced and she left abruptly. Yet, after another kiss filled with electric intensity, she decided to give their relationship a chance.
To aid in her preparation for the date, Sarah turned to Katie Andrews, a sincere student from her class. Through a fresh makeover, Sarah began to reconsider her earlier decision against dating in college. But if she was going to venture into the tumultuous sea of romance, it would have to be on her terms.
Evan happily agreed to her conditions. They embarked on a thrilling journey, with Sarah gradually discovering her romantic side and Evan improving in his academics under her tutelage. While they reveled in the present, uncertainty lingered over their future, with Sarah's indecisiveness about pursuing further studies at an Ivy League school and Evan planning a secret proposal.
At their graduation party, Evan's unexpected proposal stirred up a whirlwind of emotions in Sarah. Her practicality made her hesitate, but love won over. Yet, the thought of confronting her father, whom she had deceived about her involvement with Evan, haunted her.
Her father then presented a challenge. She could either pursue her Master's degree while accompanying Evan to Chicago or stick to her initial plan. If she chose Evan, she would lose her father's financial support. 
Sarah was torn between two futures. She knew of Evan's commitment to his sister and his promising job opportunity in Chicago, and she didn't want to impede his progress. Now she was faced with a difficult decision: adhere to the path she had meticulously planned or surrender to the whirlwind of love. After a period of deep reflection, Sarah chose Evan, allowing love to triumph over her practical considerations.</Text>

Realizing she's late for teaching her Business-101 class, she quickly packs her belongings and rushes toward the library's exit, her seminar still playing in her ears. The scene ends as she reaches the stairs, setting the stage for a chain of unforeseen events.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Undergrad Library, with its unique underground design, had been a place of solace for many University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign students. The University had made a deliberate choice to construct the library below ground level, a testament to the respect they held for the adjacent historic Morrow Plots. The Undergrad Library's subterranean architecture ensured that no shadow tainted the historic plots above.
Inside the library, the relentless fluorescent lighting illuminated Sarah Wilkins as she sat engrossed in her audio seminar. International business strategies... There's so much potential here, she thought. The seminar's captivating insights into the expansion of businesses on a global scale played through her earbuds, drowning out the muted hum of student conversations and the distant rustling of pages.
For Sarah, a teacher's assistant in the throes of her academic journey, this library had been a regular haunt. Today, she had settled into one of the study tables, surrounded by her books and notes. As a dedicated TA, Sarah was responsible for guiding the first-year students through the intricacies of Business-101.
Time seemed to slip away amidst the vast ocean of knowledge. It was only when she glanced at the time displayed on her phone that realization hit her. She was late! The class she taught would start in mere minutes. Panic surged through her veins.
She hastily packed her belongings, making sure not to pause the audio seminar. She wanted to catch every last word, even if it meant multitasking amidst the chaos. As she scooped up her books and notes, she opted to leave her earbuds in, the compelling voice in her ears serving as a comforting presence amidst her mounting anxiety.
She dashed towards the library's staircase, hoping that if she hurried, she could make it to her class on time. The echoing steps of her shoes resonated with her heartbeat, amplifying the sense of urgency. As she ascended, the world outside remained a mystery to her. With her focus on the seminar and her impending class, the last thing on her mind was what lay beyond the library's exit. </Text>

Draft Scene:
As they entered the upscale, modern apartment, Sarah and Katie naturally diverged. For Katie, unaccustomed to such luxury, the entire space was a marvel. She was entranced, her gaze traveling over the tastefully minimalist decor, pristine cleanliness, and the blend of modern furniture. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view of an untouched nature preserve in central Illinois—an unexpected gem, offering a green oasis laced with a shimmering creek.
&quot;Wow, Sarah, your place is amazing!&quot; Katie marveled, her voice slightly echoing in the vast space. She found herself gravitating toward the panoramic view, her footfalls soft against the gleaming hardwood floor.
In response, Sarah, already heading toward the kitchen, dismissively gestured with her hand. &quot;It's just home,&quot; she called back. &quot;Make yourself comfortable, Katie. Want something to drink? Coffee? Water? Or maybe a glass of wine?&quot;
Katie, still mesmerized by the vast preserve, turned at Sarah's words. &quot;Oh, I'd love some wine, but still a few years away,&quot; she said with a smirk. &quot;Better make it water.&quot;
Sarah let out a chuckle, &quot;Oh, I didn't even think about that,&quot; she admitted, her tone light and amused.
Katie said, &quot;You must be rich!&quot;
&quot;I'm not, but my father is. He owns a large corporation and pays the bills.&quot; Sarah explained as she finished pouring the drinks. She  gestured to the plush seating area that faced the scenic outdoors. &quot;Have a seat on the couch.&quot; 
Katie's youthful energy was infectious, her eyes wide with awe and excitement. &quot;Oh, my God! I love this place!&quot; Her voice rang out with pure delight, echoing around the room before she took an arm's open, playful back plunge onto the couch, her body sinking comfortably into its plush cushions. Her laughter filled the room, a joyful melody wrapped around them like a comforting blanket.
Holding a glass of chilled wine in one hand and a glass of water in the other, Sarah watched with a smile playing on her lips. She was amused by Katie's genuine delight, the vibrancy in the younger woman's eyes reflecting a life very different from her own. 
Sarah gracefully handed Katie the glass of water, then nestled into the other end of the couch, curling her legs underneath her. She held her glass of wine comfortably as she faced Katie, their eyes meeting in a silent agreement to embark on a girlish chat.

Sequence of Events:
The students of Sarah’s Business 101 course were busy taking their exams. Sarah placed a folded note on the desk of one of her brightest students, Katie Andrews. The message read, Can you meet me after class?
Katie Andrews is bubbly. She had pink highlights in her hair and always had a smile on her face. She was always quick to make a friend. At the end of class, Katie waited for all the other students to leave and then walked up to Sarah’s desk ex.
“Hi, Ms. Wilkins. What’s up?” Katie asked.
“Thank you for meeting with me. I’ve always admired your style, even though it’s different from mine. I have a first date tonight and want to look appropriate for the evening. I haven’t been on a date in a while, and I’m unsure what to wear.”
“I’d love to help!” said an excited Katie. “Are we talking wardrobe only or full makeover?”
Sarah pondered for a moment. “Whatever you think is best.”
“Really! Oh my gosh, Ms. Wilkins, I would love to do a full makeover! The other girls are going to be so jealous.”
“Why?” Sarah asked.
“In this class, it’s every girl’s fantasy to do a makeover on you, and it’s every boy’s fantasy that by day you are a stuffy, uptight teacher, but at night you’re a sexy vixen.” Katie let out a quick laugh and then said, “Oh no, I hope that didn’t sound offensive.”
Sarah laughed, “I’m not offended; I understand.”
“What time is your date?”
“It’s at 7 PM at the Thai Garden Restaurant.”
“I heard that place has great food! Do you live off-campus?”
“Yes, I have an apartment about 10 minutes away.”
“I don’t have a car. Can you pick me up by the freshman dorms in about an hour?”
“I’ll be there,” confirmed Sarah as she gave Katie a business card with her cell phone number on it.
“Great! I can’t wait.” Katie said enthusiastically and then gave Sarah a big hug. “If we are going to be friends, I’d like to call you by your first name. Would that be okay?”
“Of course, my name is Sarah.”

            <Text>The morning sun enveloped the Quad at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a radiant glow, transforming the bustling campus into a picturesque haven. A splendid day had unveiled itself, the sky an azure canvas adorned with wisps of cotton candy clouds, and the gentle breeze caressed the students, filling them with vitality and zeal.

Evan and Guido exuded an air of carefree camaraderie as they frolicked in the Quad. Their laughter rang like enchanting chimes, echoing in harmony with the beating of their hearts. The Frisbee danced between them, each throw embellished with a playful jest or a clever quip. Their bond was a masterpiece of true friendship, radiating an infectious warmth that drew others to witness their connection.

&quot;Hey, Guido, catch this one!&quot; Evan called with a deft flick of the Frisbee.

Guido's eyes sparkled with mischief as he leaped into the air, his powerful physique defying gravity with a graceful elegance. &quot;You'll have to do better than that, my friend!&quot; he replied, snatching the Frisbee effortlessly.

In the midst of their play, a serene contentment washed over Evan. The perfection of the day in the Quad was like a soothing balm, momentarily dispelling the worries and tribulations that life often brought.

Yet, amidst the laughter and joy, Evan's thoughts veered towards his sister, Liz. She was his anchor, his unwavering support through every storm. A promise made to her weighed upon his heart—to maintain a grade point average above 3.0. It was a pledge he cherished, for Liz's belief in him had always been an irreplaceable force in his life.

Guido's keen perception caught the subtle shift in Evan's countenance, and he approached with a teasing grin. &quot;Hey, Evan, you're not slacking off on us, are you?&quot;

Evan's laughter resonated, and he playfully nudged Guido's shoulder. &quot;Nah, just need some library time to keep that GPA intact. Liz is pretty serious about it.&quot;

Guido's smile softened, a glimmer of empathy in his gaze. &quot;You know she's proud of you, right? It's not just about fear, man. It's about honoring that promise and making her proud.&quot;

Evan nodded, gratitude swelling within him. &quot;Yeah, you're right, Guido. I just want to do right by her, you know?&quot;

Guido clapped him on the back, a gesture of solidarity. &quot;You got this, Evan. Now go conquer those books while I hold down the fort here.&quot;

As Evan ventured towards the library, determination surged through him. It was not fear that spurred him, but a profound love and admiration for his sister.

In the distance, the sun continued its ascent, casting a warm, golden embrace upon the Quad. Evan's footsteps were light, filled with gratitude for the friendship shared with Guido and the profound love he held for Liz.

Entering the library, the lively ambiance of the Quad faded, replaced by the gentle murmurs of students engrossed in their scholarly pursuits. Evan settled into a quiet nook, ready to embark on a voyage of knowledge and self-discovery.

As the morning sun painted the Quad with its golden hues, Evan knew that this perfect day would forever reside in his heart—a testament to the power of friendship, the warmth of love, and the promise of a radiant future ahead.</Text>

            <Synopsis>
Katie's youthful energy was infectious, her eyes wide with awe and excitement. &quot;Oh my God! I love this place!&quot; Her voice rang out with pure elation, echoing around the room before she took an arm's open playful back plunge onto the the couch, her body sinking comfortably into its plush cushions. Her laughter filled the room, a joyful melody that wrapped around them like a comforting blanket.</Synopsis>
            <Text>As they entered the upscale, modern apartment, Sarah and Katie naturally diverged. For Katie, unaccustomed to such luxury, the entire space was a marvel. She was entranced, her gaze traveling over the tastefully minimalist decor, pristine cleanliness, and the blend of modern furniture. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view of an untouched nature preserve in central Illinois—an unexpected gem, offering a green oasis laced with a shimmering creek.
&quot;Wow, Sarah, your place is amazing!&quot; Katie marveled, her voice slightly echoing in the vast space. She found herself gravitating toward the panoramic view, her footfalls soft against the gleaming hardwood floor.
In response, Sarah, already heading toward the kitchen, dismissively gestured with her hand. &quot;It's just home,&quot; she called back. &quot;Make yourself comfortable, Katie. Want something to drink? Coffee? Water? Or maybe a glass of wine?&quot;
Katie, still mesmerized by the vast preserve, turned at Sarah's words. &quot;Oh, I'd love some wine, but still a few years away,&quot; she said with a smirk. &quot;Better make it water.&quot;
Sarah let out a chuckle, &quot;Oh, I didn't even think about that,&quot; she admitted, her tone light and amused.
Once the drinks were ready, Sarah gestured to the plush seating area that faced the scenic outdoors. &quot;Have a seat on the couch,&quot; she suggested. 
Katie's youthful energy was infectious, her eyes wide with awe and excitement. &quot;Oh, my God! I love this place!&quot; Her voice rang out with pure delight, echoing around the room before she took an arm's open, playful back plunge onto the couch, her body sinking comfortably into its plush cushions. Her laughter filled the room, a joyful melody wrapped around them like a comforting blanket.
Holding a glass of chilled wine in one hand and a glass of water in the other, Sarah watched with a smile playing on her lips. She was amused by Katie's genuine delight, the vibrancy in the younger woman's eyes reflecting a life very different from her own. Sarah gracefully handed Katie the glass of water, her own chuckles mingling with Katie's laughter.
Once the laughter subsided, Sarah nestled into the other end of the couch, curling her legs underneath her. She held her glass of wine comfortably as she faced Katie, their eyes meeting in a silent agreement to embark on a girlish chat.
The afternoon sun cast a soft, golden hue through the floor-to-ceiling windows, wrapping the room in a blanket of warmth. The peaceful rustle of the trees and the delicate hum of the distant creek from the nature preserve outside created a symphony of calming sounds.
As their conversation began, the whispers of their shared secrets filled the space, intertwined with the natural sounds that flowed from outside. The stage was set for an evening that promised to etch a memorable narrative, one of shared experiences and a friendship that bloomed in the most unexpected of ways.</Text>
            <Notes>Let's notch it up another level. I really want the reader to feel Katie's excitement. 
Katie is used to a very modest lifestyle. She is absorbing this new experience at a high level. Have her say something like &quot;Oh my God! I love this place&quot; as she flops into the couch.


Old: 
With a youthful burst of energy, Katie took a playful leap, plunging backward into the plush cushions of the couch, her laughter filling the room. Sarah, holding a glass of chilled wine in one hand and water in the other, watched with an amused smile. She walked over and handed the water to Katie, who gratefully accepted it, her eyes shining with excitement. 
Sarah then nestled into the other end of the couch, curling her legs under her. The two women, drinks in hand, faced each other, ready to dive into their girlish chat. The warmth of the afternoon sun painted the room in a soft, golden hue as the whispers of their conversation began to fill the space, hinting at the memorable evening to unfold.</Notes>

            <Title>0137 Evan Has a Special Gift Made</Title>
            <Synopsis>While at the mall, seeking a special gift for his date with Sarah happens upon a unique gift idea that will memorialize their first meeting.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan's heart raced as he wandered through the maze-like corridors of the local mall, peering into one jewelry store after another. The reflection of glimmering gold and sparkling diamonds beckoned him from every window, but nothing seemed right. He wanted something unique, something special, something that would embody his feelings for Sarah.
After hours of searching without luck, frustration gnawing at him, Evan stumbled upon a small privately-owned jewelry store tucked away in a hidden corner. His eyes were immediately drawn to a display case filled with delicate glass slippers, each one only a few inches long. They were interesting and unlike anything he'd ever seen.
A surge of inspiration washed over him. He always called Sarah &quot;Cinderella.&quot; Was this a sign? Evan's steps quickened as he entered the store, captivated by the possibility.
The jewelry store owner, a gentle-looking older man, greeted Evan and explained the significance of the glass slippers. They were merely ornamental, but Evan's mind was already racing. He imagined a necklace, something symbolic, something that would connect to the way Sarah had left her glasses behind.
Evan's eyes scanned the necklaces on display, an idea forming. What if he could find a necklace with tiny little glasses as the charm? That would be perfect, unique, and meaningful.
The owner, noticing Evan's interest, offered assistance, but the store had nothing like what Evan envisioned. Undeterred, Evan thanked the man and continued his search, scouring every store in the mall with growing desperation and disappointment.
Just when he was about to give up, Evan spotted something extraordinary in the window of a vintage toy store—an old-fashioned doll wearing tiny little glasses. Excitement bubbled up within him, and he sprinted to the store, purchasing the doll without hesitation.
With renewed vigor, he returned to the small jewelry store, breathless and grinning, explaining his idea to the owner. He wanted to attach the doll's glasses to a silver necklace, a custom piece unlike anything else. 
&quot;I found something that might work! Can you help me attach these glasses to a silver necklace?&quot; Evan asked, his voice trembling with excitement.
The owner examined the glasses, then looked at Evan. &quot;I can do it, but it won't last long. It might break in the first week.&quot;
Evan's face fell, but the owner quickly continued, &quot;However, we could coat them in sterling silver and attach small eyehooks. That would make it last.&quot;
Evan's eyes lit up. &quot;Can you have it done by Thursday morning?&quot;
The owner smiled, touched by Evan's passion. &quot;Normally, I require two weeks for custom work, but for young love... Come back tomorrow, half an hour before closing. It'll be ready.&quot;
Evan's anxiety about the cost vanished when the owner quoted a price well within his budget. The relief and joy were palpable as he left the store, clutching the receipt in his hand.
Evan practically floated out of the mall, his heart light and his mind filled with anticipation. He had found the perfect gift, something special, something uniquely theirs. He knew, deep in his soul, that Sarah would be pleasantly surprised, and he couldn't wait to see the look in her eyes.</Text>

Draft Scene:
The anticipation in Sarah’s apartment was palpable. Cloud-filtered sunlight spilled through the windows, casting an encouraging glow on the room. With a swing of her arm, Sarah revealed the contents of her bedroom closet to Katie. It was an organized array, divided into clear categories: business attire, formal dresses, and a rather underpopulated section of casual clothes.
Katie's eyes widened at the sight of the designer dresses hanging with an air of elegance. &quot;Are these designer?&quot; she gasped.
Sarah's smile shone as bright as the affirmation she gave. &quot;Yes, they are.&quot;
Katie ran her fingers over the silky fabric of a deep-red gown. &quot;They're breathtaking. Do you wear these often?&quot;
Sarah tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and nodded. &quot;I do. My father sees value in contributing to the community, and it doubles as an effective networking strategy. Plus, it spruces up the resume. I manage events for several local nonprofits. I'm practically at a fundraiser or a business social every week.&quot;
Katie's eyebrows arched upwards, intrigued. &quot;I had no idea you led such an interesting life. However, for tonight, these dresses are overkill. We'll need to raid the mall for that perfect outfit. And, trust me, we're not going shopping with you looking like you're heading to a board meeting.&quot; She tossed a pair of jeans and a top at Sarah, her laughter echoing through the room.
&quot;You do have contacts, right?&quot; Katie asked as Sarah caught the clothes.
Sarah nodded in affirmation. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
&quot;Fantastic! Time to go! Change your clothes, put your contacts in, and let's swap that bun for a ponytail.&quot; Katie paused, her energy momentarily reined in. &quot;You have a Facebook account, right? I want to look at your photos. It will give me an idea of how you look in different dresses and colors. We're working against the clock, so the more I know now, the better.&quot;
Sarah, slightly taken aback by Katie's frenzy, acquiesced. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
[[ I want to add mild humor here. Katie might say, &quot;If there's nothing my eyes shouldn't see, can I log in while you get ready?&quot; Sarah might laugh and say something like, &quot;Your eyes are safe&quot; I mostly use Facebook for business contacts, academic stuff, and my nonprofit work&quot;]]]]
Sarah gestured towards her laptop resting on the table. &quot;Sure. It should auto-log you in.&quot;
With Sarah's approval, Katie darted to the dining room. Sarah was left to her transformation, as she replaced her glasses with contacts, her skirt suit with jeans, and a casual top. When she finally stepped out, her hair swishing in a loose ponytail, she was a whole new person.
Katie, absorbed in Sarah's Facebook profile, glanced up and gasped. &quot;Sarah! What a transformation. You look hot!&quot; 
Flattered, Sarah blushed, thanking Katie softly. Her confidence bloomed under the unexpected praise. 
&quot;But we're just getting started, Sarah. We are going to make you look hotter than hot! Evan won't know what hit him.&quot; Katie's words sparked an impish grin on Sarah's face.
[[Have Sarah say something like, &quot;That works for me. Let's get this party started. Consider letting the reader know this is far from Sarah's normal behavior. She is embracing the moment, just as she had when she first kissed Evan. ]]
The anticipation of their shopping spree makeover hung in the air, wrapping around them like an electric current, stirring broad, excited smiles onto their faces.

            <Title>Sarahs Father - Jack Wilkins</Title>
            <Text>Character Profile:
Name: Jack Wilkins
Gender: Male
Age: Mid-60s
Current residence: Seattle, Washington
Vehicle Driven: Bentley luxury sedan
Resembles: Actor James Cromwell
Eye Color: Blue
Hair Color: Gray
Height: 6’5”
Body type: Tall and Slender
Personality traits: 
In terms of brand archetypes, he would be considered a Ruler.
His Myers-Briggs archetype is ISTJ.
What is the character's role in the novel? 
Sarah was aware of the graduation party, but she was oblivious to the plaque that Guido and Evan had arranged for her, and more importantly, she had no clue about Evan's impending proposal. The final surprise was that Evan had invited her parents. They were kept in the dark about the proposal but were informed about the plaque presentation and asked to keep their visit a secret from Sarah. Evan's primary reason for their presence was for them to witness the proposal, a fact he kept hidden.
What Evan did not know was that Sarah had been less than honest with her parents about her relationship with him. She had mentioned Evan to them but had understated the depth of her feelings for him, and his for her. In her father's mind, Evan was merely a social companion for Sarah, and he believed that after Sarah went to an Ivy League school, they would naturally drift apart. She gave the impression that her relationship with Evan was casual.
From the back of the party room, Sarah's parents watched the unexpected proposal unfold. Caught off guard, Sarah accepted Evan's proposal in the presence of all their friends. Her father's disappointment was evident in his expression as he exited the room. Despite having to put on a happy facade as the newly-engaged woman for the rest of the party, Sarah could not shake the image of her father's disapproval and the impending confrontation.
At the conclusion of the festivities, Sarah headed to her parents' hotel room, dreading the upcoming meeting. She could manage anger, but her father's evident disappointment was a far more challenging hurdle. Nevertheless, Sarah stood firm in her decision to marry Evan. Although her mind usually guided her decisions, this time, her heart was in control.
In their meeting, her father did not display anger. Instead, he proposed a deal: he would continue to support her financially for one more month, allowing her time to make the 'right' decision, which in his eyes involved obtaining a Master's degree from a reputable Ivy League or business school and then returning to work for him in Seattle.
Her parents agreed that Evan seemed like a nice young man, but they did not believe he was the right match for Sarah. They stated that they would bless the marriage only if she achieved her Master's degree and returned to Seattle; Evan was welcome to accompany her. However, if Sarah deviated from this plan, her father would terminate his financial support.
Though some emotion escaped Sarah, the conversation remained civil. Sarah found her father's offer fair but also knew that Evan had already secured a job in Chicago and that he wanted to stay close to his sister. 
While she respected her father's stance, he, in turn, respected her decision, even though he disagreed with it. He, however, refused to provide financial support. Yet, he didn't sever ties with Sarah. They continued to stay in contact, and a few years later, when she and Evan were ready to start a business, he loaned them the startup capital. After all, he still loved his daughter.
The business proved to be a success, allowing Sarah to promptly repay the loan with interest.
Notes:
Born on a farm to farmer parents in central Illinois.
His father was a no-nonsense man, and so was Jack.
He met his wife, Mildred, in high school and married her after college.
He had minimal time to enjoy free time in his childhood preteen years. He needed to help his family by attending to duties on the farm.
He got a paying job when he was old enough and started saving for college. 
Jack believed that hard work would win the day. It was difficult for him to watch his father work his hand to the bone to make ends meet while other kids in school had lazy, overweight fathers with white-collar jobs who made triple as much.
Jack didn't want to be a struggling farmer, nor did he want to be a lazy white-collar worker. He wanted the best of both worlds. He intended to earn his wealth, embodying a farmer’s work ethic and the determination of a money-minded entrepreneur. He knew college was vital.
He went to the University of Illinois because he could remain living at home as it was nearby.
He scraped by getting loans and working long hours to pay for tuition.
He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business. 
Tired of working for others, with the support of his wife, Jack started his own business at just 25 years of age.
He experienced significant growth year after year – eventually watching his company grow into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.
He would never admit it, but he really wanted a son. He was secretly disappointed when his only child was to be a girl, Sarah.
Soon enough, he embraced his daughter. She showed signs of brilliance from an extremely early age. She accomplished all her childhood milestones well ahead of time. He decided to mentor Sarah as he would have a son.
Shortly after speaking her first words, he began to prepare her to run the company in his place one day.
This work for Sarah. She never felt cheated that she didn't have many friends or spent more time reading books than playing outside. 
Occasionally, she would want to join in on the fun, and she tried. Her parents never forced anything on her that she didn't like. If She asked for a play date or trip to the park, they accommodated her.
Even to the point where, at 16, Sarah went to her mom and dad and said she wanted to see what it was like to have a boyfriend. Instead of being upset, her father took her to the store and bought condoms. He told her that if she was going to explore her sexuality, he wanted her to be safe. It was in an emotional bond of any kind. It was just responsible, rational thinking.
It wasn't that he didn't love Sarah. He did, and Sarah loved him back. He lived a tough life and wanted Sarah to be tough, so love was never expressed through affection. Even when hugs were exchanged, it always looked and felt a little awkward.
In narrative format, provide details about this character::
Jack Wilkins is a tall, slender man in his mid-60s, with blue eyes and gray hair, resembling actor James Cromwell. He carries the no-nonsense demeanor instilled in him by his farmer father, a man who worked tirelessly to make ends meet. Born and raised on a farm in central Illinois, Jack was no stranger to hard work from a young age. He recognized early on that he did not want to follow in his father's footsteps, nor did he want to lead the life of what he saw as a complacent white-collar worker. 
For Jack, the path to prosperity laid in hard work and education. He maintained a job throughout his teenage years, saving money for college, all while continuing to contribute to the farm work. After high school, he attended the nearby University of Illinois, managing to cover his tuition through loans and working long hours.
After earning his bachelor's degree in business, Jack was ready to break free from working under others. At just 25, with the support of his high school sweetheart and now wife, Mildred, Jack embarked on his entrepreneurial journey. His determination and strong work ethic paid off as his business venture steadily grew, eventually turning into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.
Fatherhood came with its disappointments and joys for Jack. His initial disappointment of having a daughter was swiftly replaced by pride when his daughter, Sarah, demonstrated early signs of brilliance. Jack nurtured Sarah's intellect and ambition, preparing her to eventually take over the family business. His approach to parenting mirrored his overall disposition in life, rational, pragmatic, and perhaps a bit distant.
Jack's deep love for his daughter might not be easily discernible through his actions, but it has always been there. He desired Sarah to be tough and prepared for the world. The occasional awkwardness during their rare affectionate moments hinted at a man who struggled with expressing his emotions but never questioned the depth of his feelings. Jack Wilkins is not a man of many words, but his actions speak volumes about his character - a hard-working, pragmatic, and loving father who prepared his daughter for a world he knew was not always kind.</Text>

            <Title>0145 Wardrobe Check</Title>
            <Synopsis>Katie checks out Sarah's existing wardrobe to see if there is anything that she can wear on her date. Katie has Sarah swap her library and look for jeans, a T-shirt, and a ponytail – a more fun look for their girl's day out.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The anticipation in Sarah’s apartment was palpable. Cloud-filtered sunlight spilled through the windows, casting an encouraging glow on the room. With a swing of her arm, Sarah revealed the contents of her bedroom closet to Katie. It was an organized array, divided into clear categories: business attire, formal dresses, and a rather underpopulated section of casual clothes.
Katie's eyes widened at the sight of the designer dresses hanging with an air of elegance. &quot;Are these designer?&quot; she gasped.
Sarah's smile shone as bright as the affirmation she gave. &quot;Yes, they are.&quot;
Katie ran her fingers over the silky fabric of a deep-red gown. &quot;They're breathtaking. Do you wear these often?&quot;
Sarah tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and nodded. &quot;I do. My father sees value in contributing to the community, and it doubles as an effective networking strategy. It’s fulfilling work. Plus, it spruces up the resume. I manage events for several local nonprofits. I'm practically at a fundraiser or a business social every week.&quot;
Katie's eyebrows arched upwards, intrigued. &quot;I had no idea you led such an interesting life. However, for tonight, these dresses are overkill. We'll need to raid the mall for that perfect outfit. And, trust me, we're not going shopping with you looking like you're heading to a board meeting.&quot; She tossed a pair of jeans and a top at Sarah, her laughter echoing through the room.
&quot;You do have contact lenses, right?&quot; Katie asked as Sarah caught the clothes.
Sarah nodded in affirmation. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
&quot;Fantastic! Time to go! Change your clothes, put your contacts in, and let's swap that bun for a ponytail,&quot; Katie ordered, her voice bubbling with excitement.
&quot;Yes, Sir Sergeant,&quot; Sarah saluted, mock seriousness on her face.
&quot;You said I was in charge,&quot; Katie shot back, pretending to pout.
&quot;That I did,&quot; Sarah replied, and they both burst into laughter, the joyous sound filling the room.
Katie paused, her energy momentarily reined in. &quot;You have a Facebook account, right? I want to look at your photos. It will give me an idea of how you look in different dresses and colors. We're working against the clock, so the more I know now, the better.&quot;
Sarah, slightly taken aback by Katie's frenzy, acquiesced. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
&quot;If there's nothing my eyes shouldn't see, can I log in while you get ready?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes twinkling with mischief.
Sarah laughed. &quot;Your eyes are safe. I mostly use Facebook for business contacts, academic pursuits , and my nonprofit work.&quot;
Sarah gestured towards her laptop resting on the table. &quot;Sure. It should auto-log you in.&quot;
With Sarah's approval, Katie darted to the dining room. Sarah was left to her transformation, as she replaced her glasses with contacts, her skirt suit with jeans, and a casual top. When she finally stepped out, her hair swishing in a loose ponytail, she was a whole new person.
Katie, absorbed in Sarah's Facebook profile, glanced up and gasped. &quot;Sarah! What a transformation. You look hot!&quot;
Flattered, Sarah blushed, thanking Katie softly. Her confidence bloomed under the unexpected praise.
&quot;But we're just getting started, Sarah. We are going to make you look hotter than hot! Evan won't know what hit him.&quot; Katie's words sparked an impish grin on Sarah's face.
&quot;That works for me. Let's get this party started,&quot; Sarah replied, her voice tinged with excitement. It was far from her normal behavior, but she was embracing the moment, just as she had when she first kissed Evan.
The anticipation of their shopping spree makeover hung in the air, wrapping around them like an electric current, stirring broad, excited smiles onto their faces.</Text>

Sarah grinned, a surprising lightness in her tone. &quot;I haven’t dated since I was 16.&quot;
&quot;16? Wowza!&quot; Katie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. But she wasn't done probing, her next question laced with a touch of delicacy. &quot;If you don’t mind me asking, are you a...&quot; She paused, &quot;virgin?&quot;
&quot;No, I’m not a virgin,&quot; Sarah confessed, the hesitation barely noticeable. &quot;I experimented for a short time in high school, but I didn't see what was so great about it.&quot;
Katie leaned in closer, her voice a comforting whisper. &quot;It will be way different when you find the right guy.” 
A mischievous twinkle lit up in Sarah's eyes, an expression that silently echoed, &quot;Maybe!?&quot; This was a different Sarah, one who was open to the possibility of something more, something exciting, something like... Evan.
Seizing the moment, Katie ventured to ask, &quot;Do you think Evan may be the right guy?&quot;
The response was immediate, Sarah's smile reaching her eyes as she raised her eyebrows. &quot;He's the right guy if he makes love even half as good as he kisses!&quot; 
Their giggles echoed around the room, the atmosphere brimming with anticipation and the sheer joy of newfound possibilities. The girls were truly ready for a night that promised to be a roller coaster of emotions and revelations.</Text>

            <Text>Sarah dashed out of the library, her heart hammering as her earbuds thrummed a fast beat that matched her urgency. Her frantic thoughts echoed around the consequences of tardiness. Late for class. Again. The sun streamed down, painting the library's concrete steps in sharp relief, a chasm she seemed destined to tumble into, oblivious and in too much of a hurry to care.

A distant shout echoed around her. A man's voice, strong and steady. &quot;Hey, lady in the skirt suit!&quot; A murmur of chuckles rose around her. Yet, the warning, laced with a tinge of humor, didn't permeate the bubble of her preoccupied mind.

Then, out of nowhere, he was there—Evan. A streak of motion blurred into her peripheral vision, too late for her to process. He was nothing more than a stranger, just another face in the crowd before today, but he seemed determined to change that.

He reached her, his hands fastening around her waist just in time. The world twirled, a dizzying spin that sent her body arching back against his, as if they were dancers in a grand ballroom rather than students in front of a bustling library. She felt her briefcase, purse, and their contents scatter. Her glasses slipped from her nose, tumbling to the ground.

As she leaned back, her hair, previously constrained in a strict bun, cascaded around her, a curtain of soft curls brushing the ground. Evan's grip on her tightened. As she met his gaze, she saw surprise flicker across his features, quickly replaced by something softer, warmer. Recognition, perhaps.

&quot;I feel like I should kiss you,&quot; he said, his voice a soft murmur that tugged at the edges of her consciousness. The world seemed to slow down, her impending lateness fading to a distant worry. She found herself smiling. &quot;I am not going to stop you.&quot;

They kissed. A moment of warmth and connection amidst the chaos. After the kiss, Evan lifted her back to her feet. As if waking from a dream, the realization of her lateness crashed back onto her. She scrambled for her scattered belongings, with Evan's help.

&quot;What's your name?&quot; he asked, his voice calm against her frantic actions.

&quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot; she blurted out, hardly thinking about her words.

&quot;That's a strange name,&quot; Evan chuckled, his words sending an unexpected ripple of humor through her. But she had no time for humor, or names, or handsome strangers who kissed her in front of libraries.

Sarah took off, leaving her broken glasses behind. She heard Evan call out to her, but she didn't turn back. She couldn't. She left him there, glasses in hand and a grin on his face, a promise hanging in the air of a future encounter that felt as inevitable as it was unforeseen.

The writing style used in this scene was Deep POV (Point of View), focusing on Sarah's perspective to immerse the reader in her thoughts, feelings, and sensory experiences.</Text>

Title: The College Days
Genre: Romance
Plot Summary:
For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, their first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is underway. They've never met, as their social circles don't intersect. Evan, a charismatic, athletic young man, commands popularity not by choice but by virtue of his outgoing personality. Despite his natural allure, he remains grounded thanks to the guidance from his saintly sister, Liz, treating everyone with kindness.
Evan isn't the most diligent student, preferring the outdoors to the confines of classrooms and libraries. However, to uphold a promise to Liz, he's striving for a minimum GPA of 3.0. As he enters his senior year, his grades are teetering on this threshold, and he is compelled to trade Frisbee games for study sessions at the undergrad library.
Contrastingly, Sarah is a stellar student, poised to graduate at the top of her class. As a business major and teaching assistant, she considers the library her sanctuary, often losing herself in riveting audio seminars, like one on international business strategies. One day, engrossed in her seminar, she realizes she's running late for a class she's teaching. In her rush, she neglects her surroundings and dashes towards a flight of stairs without a handrail.
Evan, heading her way, spots the impending accident. He calls out to her, but she doesn't hear him. He dashes to intercept her before she reaches the stairs, catching her just in time. This unexpected encounter leads to a spontaneous, passionate kiss. 
Sarah, brought up with a single-minded focus on academics and preparing to take over her father's business, has little experience with romance. She had sworn off any romantic entanglements until she completed her Master’s degree and embarked on her professional journey. 
In a whirlwind, Sarah leaves without providing Evan her name or contact. Later, Evan manages to track her down, returning a pair of glasses she had left behind and charming her into taking a break at the food court. Despite her initial hesitation, she gives in to Evan’s allure. 
Their encounter at the food court leaves Sarah questioning herself as she witnesses Evan’s popularity, especially among the female students. Feeling out of place, she retreats, but Evan convinces her to agree to a date. Uncertain about dating norms, Sarah enlists the help of one of her top students, Katie, to modernize her look and prep her for the date. 
During their date, Sarah proposes a business-like arrangement with Evan, setting rules and expectations and prioritizing her academics. Evan, who has been smitten since their first encounter, happily agrees. As they continue to see each other, Sarah allows herself to experience romance and affection, while Evan becomes a better student with Sarah’s help. 
Their senior year unfolds beautifully. Sarah expands her social circle, and Evan lands a good job in Chicago. As graduation approaches, however, Sarah grapples with her future choices – Ivy League schools for her Master's or staying with Evan. Unbeknownst to her, Evan plans to propose at the graduation party, inviting her parents for the surprise.
Sarah, who has downplayed the seriousness of their relationship to her parents, is taken aback by Evan’s proposal. She fears disappointing her father by deviating from her initial plan. Following the party, her father presents her with two choices – follow Evan to Chicago and build a life there, or stick to the original plan of pursuing her Master's and eventually joining her father’s business. If she chooses Evan, her father will cut off financial support.
Sarah is torn between her love for Evan and her commitment to her father. Despite the complexities, her heart prevails, and she chooses to build a life with Evan in Chicago. Sarah and Evan elope. 
While all indications are the happy couple is excited and ready to start a life together, all may not be as it seems.
After a quick marriage ceremony, and Sarah and Evan are officially married, Sarah retreats to the lady’s restroom. Stonefaced, she stares at herself in the mirror and asks herself, &quot;Oh my god. What have I done!?&quot;

            <Title>Evan. No Pov</Title>
            <Text>In the sun-soaked landscape outside of the Undergrad Library, a multitude of students rushed from one destination to another, and amidst this chaos, Sarah emerged from the library. Her pace quick, her expression a mashup of concentration and anxiety. She wore a skirt suit and had her hair pinned up in a bun. To Evan, who  was walking towards her, she looked like one of the university professors.
In her ears were the earbuds that connected her to the world of her audio seminar and disconnected her from the immediate reality. Oblivious to her surroundings, she strode briskly towards the wide concrete steps that led downwards from the library's exit, her hand firmly grasping a briefcase and a purse. The railings were too far to offer any immediate support if she missed a step, a danger she seemed blissfully unaware of.
&quot;Hey, lady in the skirt suit!&quot; Evan called out, trying to warn her. His words echoed amongst the buzz of conversations around them, but failed to reach Sarah, lost in her own rhythm.
There was no time to waste. Evan sprinted towards her, the distance between them closing rapidly but not rapidly enough. Just as she was about to step into oblivion, he caught her by the arm. The momentum swung her around, her body swaying backward in a dip reminiscent of a dance move, and all her belongings flew off in every direction. Her glasses slipped off her face and clattered onto the concrete, a barrette popped open letting her bun unravel into a cascade of long hair that just grazed the ground.
Evan could now see she was a student, much like himself, not a professor as he'd initially thought. Their eyes met and locked. It was as if time had slowed down, their surroundings blurring into insignificance. His heart pounded in his chest, the adrenaline from his heroic sprint was now replaced by another kind of excitement.
&quot;I feel like I should kiss you,&quot; he said, the words slipping out before he could stop them.
Sarah's smile told him everything he needed to know. She was caught up in the magic of the moment just as he was.
&quot;I'm not going to stop you,&quot; she whispered back.
He pulled her closer, their lips meeting in a deep passionate kiss. It was a moment stolen from time, a connection made amidst chaos. When they finally pulled apart, Evan helped her up to her feet.
She looked at her scattered belongings and her watch, the reality of her tardiness hitting her. In a frenzy, she started gathering her things, with Evan helping her.
&quot;Wait! What's your name?&quot; Evan asked her, wanting to have something more than just a memory of the passionate kiss.
&quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot; she answered. 
&quot;That's a strange name.&quot; He couldn't help but chuckle.
His eyes followed her retreating figure until he noticed something lying near his feet. Her glasses. He called out to her, waving the glasses in the air, but she either couldn't hear him or chose not to respond. With a grin, he watched her disappear into the distance. She had left in a hurry, leaving behind her glasses and an unforgettable memory.
A lighthearted smile stretched across his face as he held the glasses in his hand. They were a memento, a promise of an encounter that he was sure was meant to happen. He looked down at the glasses, then back in the direction Sarah had run off to, anticipation for their next meeting lighting up his eyes.</Text>

            <Title>0160 Sarah &amp; Evan’s First Date</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah and Evan meet at an Asian restaurant for their first official date. Sarah suggests that they begin a relationship with certain conditions. Evan happily agrees.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah stood outside the Thai Garden Restaurant on Kirby Avenue. The partly cloudy weather created a comforting ambiance, a nice backdrop to the pulsating anxiety that ebbed within her. Through the window, she could see Evan texting on his phone, his fingers flying over the screen, a look of expectation in his eyes. She felt a mix of excitement and apprehension, a cocktail of emotions that made her heart race. It was unlike her, this inability to walk away and maintain her no-dating policy. But even an emotional Sarah was never truly out of control; she had a plan, as always.
Her new dress ensemble, chosen with Katie's help, clung to her figure, making her look &quot;hot&quot; but not over the top. It was an elegant blend of confidence and allure, something she hoped would strike the right note.
Evan waited anxiously, trying to find someone to text to help pass the time. He felt a presence over his shoulder and looked up, then back to his phone. A second later, he looked back again, his heart leaping as he realized it was Sarah. Seeing her brought a genuine smile to his face. Evan stood up and kissed Sarah, his lips gentle on her cheek.
“I almost didn’t recognize you. Did you do all this for me?” he asked, referring to her makeover.
“I was in the mood to change things up a bit,” Sarah replied, her eyes moving up and to the right, her lips curling into a sly grin.
“Looking for a change, are you? I hope that bodes well for me.” Evan laughed, his eyes twinkling.
“We’ll see,” she said, a hint of mystery in her voice.
“Let’s go eat!” Evan said, leading her to the table.
When they got to the table, Evan pulled out the seat for Sarah, his movements graceful and practiced. “Thank you. You are quite the gentleman,” she said, her voice soft.
“You look great! But you know you didn’t have to change anything for me. You are beautiful now, you're just as beautiful as when I first laid eyes on you,” Evan said, his voice sincere.
Their server appeared just as Evan finished his compliment, ready to take their orders. After drinks were ordered, Evan went with the Spicy Pad Thai, and Sarah settled on the Som Tam.
“I was worried you wouldn’t show up,” Evan said, his eyes searching hers.
“I told you I always keep my appointments,” she replied, catching herself. “Sorry, poor choice of words. Why don’t we start this date off with you telling me a little about yourself?”          
Evan nodded, his hands resting comfortably on the edge of the table. &quot;Fair enough. I'm a pretty simple guy. I work as a personal trainer at the gym down the street. I like to play sports, hike, run, bike, anything that gets me outside. I enjoy hanging out with my friends. Anything else you want to know?&quot;
Sarah's curiosity was piqued. &quot;What's your major? Are you a good student?&quot;
Evan leaned back, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. &quot;I'm majoring in software development with a minor in marketing. I guess I'm a good student when I apply myself. At least, that's what my sister would say. I don't enjoy being cooped up in a classroom, but I promised her I would maintain a decent GPA. That's how I met you. I was heading to the library to study to maintain my GPA.&quot;
Their conversation flowed naturally, their words carrying them through stories of family, interests, and aspirations. Sarah felt a growing sense of connection with Evan, discovering a depth to him that she hadn't initially expected. As their food arrived, they paused their conversation to savor the delicious aromas filling the air.
&quot;This food looks and smells delicious!&quot; Sarah exclaimed after taking a bite. &quot;It even tastes better than it looks. Excellent choice of restaurants!&quot;
Evan chuckled, a pleased expression on his face. &quot;I don't get to come here very often, but I love their food.&quot;
As they continued their meal, their conversation flowed seamlessly, each topic leading to another. Sarah shared her experiences as an events coordinator for nonprofit organizations, and Evan expressed his admiration for her philanthropic work.
As the conversation took a more lighthearted turn, Evan's eyes sparkled with mischief. &quot;Let me guess. So you can make more contacts!&quot;
Sarah grinned, her eyes dancing. &quot;You find me one-dimensional, don't you?&quot;
Evan leaned forward, his playfulness mixed with genuine interest. &quot;I'm quite impressed with what you have told me. I like the idea of getting involved with nonprofit organizations. It just seems like you should allow some time for fun.&quot;
Sarah's smile softened, and she leaned in closer. &quot;I'm here with you, aren't I?&quot;
Evan's response was genuine, his tone soft and sincere. &quot;Yes, you are! I'm happy about that.&quot;
As the meal drew to a close, they continued chatting, their connection growing stronger with each passing moment. Sarah ordered a small espresso, and Evan opted for a piece of cheesecake. Their words flowed effortlessly, their chemistry palpable.
&quot;I was wondering if I could make a proposal?&quot; Sarah ventured, her voice a mix of determination and uncertainty.
Evan arched an eyebrow playfully, his lips curving into a grin. &quot;A proposal already? We just met,&quot; he joked. &quot;Go ahead; I'm all ears.&quot;
&quot;Since I met you, I've been reconsidering my thoughts on relationships,&quot; Sarah began, her words measured and purposeful. &quot;A relationship is a partnership, and I wanted to propose that we form one. In business, it's essential to identify all foreseeable issues before signing an agreement.&quot;
As the weight of her words hung in the air, Sarah continued, her gaze steady. &quot;My father taught me that it's best to lead with what I have to offer first. So, here's what I can provide to this partnership: I can teach you study techniques to improve your grades with minimal effort. As a romantic partner, I can already tell you'll want me to break out of my shell and socialize with your friends and others in my age group. I can't promise I'll attend every party or social event, but I'll accompany you as often as I can. If there's a particular event that's important to you, I'll make an effort to be there.&quot;
She paused, her expression honest and open. &quot;As adults in a romantic relationship, I expect there will be some physical intimacy involved. I want to be upfront with you. I'm not a virgin, but I'm also not very experienced. I haven't been on a date since I was 16 years old.&quot;
Evan interjected with a thoughtful query. &quot;May I ask a question?&quot; Sarah nodded, giving him permission to continue. &quot;I play softball every Sunday morning. Will you be able to come to my games?&quot;
&quot;My schedule is usually clear on Sunday mornings,&quot; Sarah replied, her tone assuring. &quot;I should be able to make it to many of your games.&quot;
Evan's excitement was palpable, evident in the eager look on his face. &quot;Continue with your proposal,&quot; he encouraged.
Sarah picked up where she left off, her words resolute. &quot;The most important thing to me is that you understand my academic career comes first. That means no pressuring me to attend parties or spend
 time together until after I've tended to my studies.&quot;
Her gaze met Evan's with unwavering intensity. &quot;I attend a lot of formal events. Just as I'll attend your social events, I expect the same in return. Keep in mind these aren't frat parties.&quot;
Evan's voice carried a playful note as he questioned her assumption. &quot;Is that what you think I am, a frat boy?&quot;
Sarah quickly clarified, her tone earnest. &quot;I didn't mean to imply that. I just want you to know that you might need to dress up for some of these events. They're also an opportunity for you to make connections. The more contacts you have, the better chance you'll get the job you want after graduation.&quot;
A playful back-and-forth ensued, each of them sharing their thoughts candidly. &quot;Here we go again with the contacts,&quot; Evan remarked, eliciting a smile from Sarah.
&quot;It's not just that,&quot; she explained, her voice softening with sincerity. &quot;I like you. It would mean a lot to me to have you by my side at any event. I haven't been able to stop thinking about you since the moment you kissed me. If we let our relationship develop naturally, I might never regain my focus.&quot;
Evan's admission was filled with genuine emotion. &quot;I feel the same. You've been the only thing on my mind for the last week. I can't focus any better than you can. There's something about you that's so different and special. It's like somehow, I already know it's going to work out. There's nothing I want more than to bypass the whole dating phase and call you my girlfriend.&quot;
With a newfound clarity, Sarah spoke her conclusion. &quot;That's my proposal then. Do you have a counter-proposal?&quot;
Evan's response was enthusiastic, filled with approval. &quot;No counter-proposal. I'm in total agreement!&quot;
Sarah laughed, her voice light and carefree. &quot;My father said if they accept your first offer, you offered too much.&quot;
Evan's perspective was both endearing and practical. &quot;Look at it from my point of view. You said you would attend my games, explore your sexuality with me when you're ready, help me connect with potential employers, and assist me in getting good grades. What more could I ask for?&quot;
With a sense of formality, Sarah extended her hand for a handshake. &quot;So we have a deal?&quot;
Evan's response was swift, rejecting the notion of a mere handshake. &quot;No way are we sealing this deal with a handshake.&quot;
The unspoken implication hung between them, charged with anticipation. As Evan called for the check, their agreement was settled. With the bill paid and a shared understanding, he escorted Sarah out of the restaurant, their journey together taking a promising new turn.</Text>

            <Synopsis>In what format would you like me to provide you with this information?</Synopsis>
            <Text>Any format that you find convenient would work, but here's a suggestion on how you could structure it:
Genre and Setting: Briefly describe the genre of the novel (romance, fantasy, sci-fi, etc.) and where and when the story is set. This could be as simple as &quot;modern day New York City&quot; or as complex as &quot;a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world where...&quot;
Characters: Give me a short description of your main characters, their personalities, motivations, backgrounds, etc. This can be bullet point form or in prose.

            <Title>0122 Sarah Can't Concentrate</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah can't focus on her academic work because her mind is thinking of Evan.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0122 Sarah Can't Concentrate
Characters: Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Undergrad Library - Remember that this library is underground with no windows.
Time of Day: Morning
Tone: Jumbled emotions and internal conflict.
Weather: The weather outside is perfect, but the library is underground, so the current state of the weather is not apparent.
Special Instructions: 
To keep the scene interesting, consider making Sarah's nervous energy and inability to focus cause her to perform menial tasks. Such as:
- Straighten up the work area in front of her.
- Clean her eyeglasses.
- Organize her purse.
- Aimlessly searching through the aisles of books, pulling out and putting back books she knows she has no intention of reading.
- etc.

There is no outward dialogue in this scene. This is a set-up scene, so the reader will know Sarah's mindset in the moments before Evan finally finds her in the library. I really want the reader to feel like she's there with Sarah. Helpful to accomplish that goal will be a complete, vivid description of the inside of the library. The undergrad library is not overly quiet, although no one's allowed to yell or scream. I will provide a narrative to describe the library for this scene. Feel free to use it as is or modify it as needed.
Undergrad Library Description:
The Undergraduate Library was a flurry of activity and bright, relentless fluorescent lighting. Instead of a quiet sanctuary, it was a hub of engagement, a hive buzzing with the energy of youthful minds. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a stark, almost clinical glow over the rows of tables and chairs, making the room feel less like a typical library and more like a vibrant community center.
Groups of students huddled together at the tables, doing their best to keep their voices down but often failing in those efforts, as evidenced by scolding looks from others trying to study.
In corners and along the aisles between bookshelves, there were pockets of flirtation. Amidst the academic pursuit, the library also served as a social arena, a meeting point for like-minded individuals who could connect over shared study materials and the occasional whispered joke. A glance stolen across the study table, a shy smile in response to a witty remark, the quiet exchange of notes - these were as common in the library as textbooks and highlighters.
It was more than a library; it was a microcosm of college life, a blend of hard work, cooperation, and the undercurrent of budding romance. Students came for the books but stayed for the energy and camaraderie that hummed through the bright, lively room.
Sequence of Events:
I want a vivid description of the undergrad library as the backdrop for Sarah's internal conflict and lack of focus. 
Integrate Sarah's emotions and inner thoughts as you describe the library’s environment.
Somewhere in the scene, Sarah puts her hair in a bun. It's important that this happens for reasons that become apparent as our story continues.
For the first time in her college career, Sarah couldn't focus on her academic work. 
Whenever she tried to study, her mind wandered back to the kiss and the man who kissed her.
Sarah felt like an observer as her mind split in two. The left side of her brain reminded her of her vow to avoid romance, the right side embracing the feeling of every cell of her body craving romance, craving just one more kiss.
Sarah thought, “Is this what all women feel like when attracted to a man? How do they ever get anything done?&quot;
Try as she might, Sarah could not overcome the distraction her thoughts of Evan were causing.
She felt lucky that she was always way ahead in her schoolwork. Otherwise, she would be in trouble. She had accomplished virtually nothing in the days following the kiss.</Text>

            <Title>Prompts</Title>
            <Text>I've broken up my story into three separate novels.
I consider the first novel a prequel, and I will call the first novel “Book 1.”
I consider the second novel the main one and will call it “Book 2.”
I consider the first novel a sequel, and I will call it “Book 3.”
Does that make sense?
Book 1 will be the smallest of the three books. I consider it a novella. It contains the back story of when Evan met Sarah. It begins on the day he meets Sarah and concludes on the day they get married.
It acts as a prologue and is optional for my readers. Does that make sense?
Book 2 begins with Evan and Sarah's divorce. Since the backstory prequel is optional, I will include minimal flashback scenes to catch the reader up.
After the divorce and the flashback scenes, the story will move into the inception of Evan's unique relationship strategy. In the report, Chloe names Evan's idea the &quot;Love, Annually Relationship Strategy.&quot; 
Book 2 will then follow Evan through his relationship one-year with Girl #1, Gabriella, Girl #2, and finally, his soulmate Chloe.
Book 2 will cover Evan and Chloe's fantastic year together, the breakup, and Chloe's return to Chicago, and cover her accident and recovery. Book 2 will and with two major pop resolved. First, Evan and Chloe get engaged. Second, the subplot of Liz's infertility is resolved in that she gets pregnant.
Does that make sense?
Absolutely, I apologize for the misunderstanding. Here is the corrected summary:
Book 3 starts with Chloe in the greenroom, moments away from her appearance on a popular talk show, much like Oprah's. She's there because of her published journals, which were originally gifts from Evan during her recovery. Titled &quot;Love, Annually,&quot; the book captivates the public with its honest exploration of personal emotions such as anger and jealousy and its introduction of Evan's unconventional approach to relationships.
As the book gains fame, Evan and Chloe build a dating website dedicated to their unique one-year relationship strategy. Chloe thrives in the limelight while Evan, being more reserved, only occasionally joins her for book signings.
Their relationship endures strain when Chloe considers a tubal ligation. Evan initially opposes the decision, leading to tension. However, Chloe eventually decides against the procedure, allowing them to reconcile and deepen their relationship.
The last stop on their book tour brings them to Portland, Oregon, near Sarah's home in Seattle. When Sarah unexpectedly appears, Chloe experiences a wave of jealousy that spirals into misunderstandings, leading to the abrupt end of her engagement with Evan.
Full of regret, Chloe later befriends Sarah and aids in repairing her public image. This act leads to her reconciliation with Evan, and they once again plan their wedding.
In a minor subplot, Guido finds love with Dakota. Following this diversion, the primary narrative continues with Evan and Chloe's wedding. During the vows, Chloe surprises everyone by expressing her desire to have two children with Evan, creating a ripple of shock and excitement at the wedding.
However, their happiness is challenged upon their return from the honeymoon when Evan is diagnosed with a rare bone disease. His life expectancy dramatically decreases unless he receives a bone marrow transplant, but no suitable donors are immediately available.
In response, Chloe collaborates with Evan's doctor to establish a bone marrow recruitment program, using her fame to encourage potential donors. An unlikely match emerges in Owen, a man Evan had helped in Book 2. Despite initial hesitance due to his wife's concerns, Owen eventually agrees to the procedure.
The transplant surgery is successfully carried out just in time. When Chloe visits Evan post-operation, she lightheartedly names him as his own savior, because it was his act of kindness that led to Owen becoming his donor. Evan, however, insists that Chloe is the real hero. Her tireless effort throughout their journey ensured his survival and made a significant impact on others awaiting a bone marrow transplant.
Book 3 concludes with Evan and Chloe, more deeply in love than ever before, preparing for their new life chapter, savoring every moment and cherishing their annual love – and beyond. The book beautifully ends their tale, which is filled with romance, introspection, drama, and triumph over real-world hardships.</Text>

            <Title>Part 1: Intro</Title>
            <Text>As they entered the upscale, modern apartment, Sarah and Katie naturally diverged. For Katie, unaccustomed to such luxury, the entire space was a marvel. She was entranced, her gaze traveling over the tastefully minimalist decor, pristine cleanliness, and the blend of modern furniture. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view of an untouched nature preserve in central Illinois—an unexpected gem, offering a green oasis laced with a shimmering creek.
&quot;Wow, Sarah, your place is amazing!&quot; Katie marveled, her voice slightly echoing in the vast space. She found herself gravitating toward the panoramic view, her footfalls soft against the gleaming hardwood floor.
In response, Sarah, already heading toward the kitchen, dismissively gestured with her hand. &quot;It's just home,&quot; she called back. &quot;Make yourself comfortable, Katie. Want something to drink? Coffee? Water? Or maybe a glass of wine?&quot;
Katie, still mesmerized by the vast preserve, turned at Sarah's words. &quot;Oh, I'd love some wine, but still a few years away,&quot; she said with a smirk. &quot;Better make it water.&quot;
Sarah let out a chuckle, &quot;Oh, I didn't even think about that,&quot; she admitted, her tone light and amused.
Katie said, &quot;You must be rich!&quot;
&quot;I'm not, but my father is. He owns a large corporation and pays the bills.&quot; Sarah explained as she finished pouring the drinks. She  gestured to the plush seating area that faced the scenic outdoors. &quot;Have a seat on the couch.&quot; 
Katie's youthful energy was infectious, her eyes wide with awe and excitement. &quot;Oh, my God! I love this place!&quot; Her voice rang out with pure delight, echoing around the room before she took an arm's open, playful back plunge onto the couch, her body sinking comfortably into its plush cushions. Her laughter filled the room, a joyful melody wrapped around them like a comforting blanket.
Holding a glass of chilled wine in one hand and a glass of water in the other, Sarah watched with a smile playing on her lips. She was amused by Katie's genuine delight, the vibrancy in the younger woman's eyes reflecting a life very different from her own. 
Sarah gracefully handed Katie the glass of water, then nestled into the other end of the couch, curling her legs underneath her. She held her glass of wine comfortably as she faced Katie, their eyes meeting in a silent agreement to embark on a girlish chat.

            <Title>Evan's POV</Title>
            <Text>Evan strode into the library, his eyes scanning the sea of tables and bookshelves. It was a shot in the dark to think he would recognize her in such a large crowd. But there, towards the back, sat a figure dressed in a business suit with hair wound in a tight bun. His heart leapt. The mystery woman from their unexpected encounter.

She was already watching him, he noticed as he headed her way. A blush bloomed across her cheeks, and she tried to hide her face behind the book she was holding. He held back a chuckle. There was something endearing about the sight of her trying to hide behind a dense medical textbook. 

As he approached, she peeked up at him over the edge of the book, eyes wide. She set the book down and straightened in her seat, her chest rising and falling a bit too quickly. Holding out the pair of glasses he had fixed, he asked, &quot;May I?&quot; 

Her breath hitched slightly, but she gave a hesitant nod, her eyes fluttering closed as his hands moved toward her face. He gently removed her current glasses and replaced them with the repaired pair.

&quot;Ah, much better,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;Not that there's anything wrong with the glasses you were wearing, but I like these a lot better. I hope I did a good job fixing them?&quot; 

Her eyes blinked open, adjusting to the new lenses. &quot;Yes, you did. Thank you. How much do I owe you?&quot; 

His smile widened. &quot;You don’t owe me anything! But you can join me for a snack at the food court. We could call it an energy exchange?&quot;

She hesitated, biting her lip. &quot;I have studying to do.&quot;

He gave her a playful grin. &quot;You can’t take a half-hour break?&quot; 

&quot;I have a lot to study,&quot; she insisted.

&quot;Well, I have to study too!&quot; He disappeared briefly behind a bookshelf, returning moments later with a book of his own. He sat across from her, intentionally holding his book upside down.

&quot;Do you always read your books upside down?&quot; she asked, failing to suppress a laugh.

He flipped the book, revealing the title - Female Poets of the 19th Century. &quot;Ah, now this book makes more sense!&quot; he replied, chuckling at his own joke. 

Her laugh filled the air between them. “Can you even name one?” she teased.

“Emily Dickinson!” he shot back confidently.

“Do you know that, or is she the only female poet you’ve heard of?”

“I am an expert on female poetry from the 19th century!” he declared, and her laughter filled the room once again.

His charm was chipping away at her resolve, he noticed as she attempted to return to her study materials. He opened the book again, altering his tone to mimic a professor's. &quot;Very nice. Excellent poetic structure. Great use of hyperbole.&quot;

“You are going to keep annoying me until I agree to go to the food court, aren’t you?” she said, trying to stifle her giggles.

“Annoying? I was shooting for charming!” he exclaimed, feigning shock. Her laughter echoed around them.

“Okay, fine, annoyingly charming.”

He sobered a bit, &quot;I’ll stop bothering you if you want. But I say let’s get to know each other. Unless I imagined it, that kiss was wonderful for you, too. All I’m asking for is 15 minutes. That’s it, just 15 minutes of your time! What do you say?”

Silence hung in the air as she seemed to weigh his words, finally relenting as she packed up her things. &quot;Is that a yes?&quot; he asked, already knowing the answer.

“Yes, it is!” She smiled at him, and it was all the confirmation he needed.
As they readied to leave, Evan stepped aside, gesturing for her to lead the way. With a small smile, she passed him, and he followed, reaching the door first to hold it open for her. Together, they stepped out into the perfect morning sunlight. A sense of anticipation, a blossoming of something new and exciting, filled the air. The scene was set - there was chemistry, there was romance, and there was a whole world waiting for them to explore together. 
*The author's style used in this scene was Romantic and Realistic.*</Text>

            <Title>WIP with more narrative</Title>
            <Text>Sarah's feet were brisk against the sidewalk, the rhythm of her steps resonating with the morning's hurried energy. Yet, her speed wasn't enough. She heard Evan's voice calling out behind her, his tone playfully admonishing, &quot;Hey, Cinderella, wait up!&quot;
She halted in her tracks, her heart thrumming in her chest. Turning back, she faced him, a bewildered expression etched on her face. &quot;Why do you call me Cinderella?&quot;
Evan's easy smile danced in the sunlight, as though he were a character plucked straight from a charming romance novel. His eyes, bright with humor, crinkled at the corners. &quot;Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”
“And why are you so adamant about chasing after me?&quot; She countered, a defiant edge lacing her words. &quot;It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.&quot;
Caught in the gravity of his gaze, Sarah noted the determination etched in his features. &quot;I want to learn more about you,&quot; Evan stated simply, standing tall in his conviction. &quot;What’s wrong with that?”
Sarah huffed, her chest rising and falling with the rhythm of her disbelief. &quot;It doesn’t take a genius to see that we exist in different worlds.”
His laughter, unexpected and genuine, echoed around them. “Let me guess. You’re a genius?”
“That’s not my point.”
The tranquility of Evan's demeanor was compelling. His gaze was patient and unwavering as he prompted, “Then what is your point?”
“As a couple, we make little sense. I came to college to get an education and network with professionals to further my academic and professional careers. I committed to focusing on my work and refraining from distracting relationships. You don’t need me. You must know every female on campus.”
Evan smiled, his grin a heartrending blend of sincerity and charm. “Are you jealous? You have nothing to worry about.”
&quot;I’m not jealous. I simply can’t understand why you’re focusing your attention on me,&quot; Sarah replied, her arms crossed over her chest, a physical barrier to the emotions threatening to spill over. Her eyes, brimming with questions, searched his.
Evan looked at her, his gaze reflecting a mix of curiosity and genuine interest. &quot;I don't know, Sarah. There's just something about you. You're different from the girls I'm used to meeting.&quot;
&quot;You don't even know me,&quot; she countered, her voice softer than intended, her gaze shifting to the ground, avoiding his penetrating stare.
He nodded, acknowledging her point. &quot;That's true,&quot; he admitted, a breeze lifting a lock of his hair as he met her gaze again. &quot;But let me ask you something. Why did you kiss me? Why are you here with me now instead of studying?&quot;
Her response was a mere whisper, lost amidst the symphony of the city sounds around them. She shifted on her feet, her foot tracing an absent pattern on the pavement. &quot;Other than the obvious…&quot; she began, implying Evan's good looks. Her voice tapered off to a whisper, &quot;I don't know either.&quot;
A persuasive plea was etched in Evan's eyes as he stepped closer to her, the distance between them shrinking to a mere breath. &quot;Well, let's find out together,&quot; he said earnestly, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Go to dinner with me.”
Silence enveloped them, the sounds of the bustling city fading into a distant hum. Evan waited for her answer, each second stretching into an eternity. Finally, when the silence had stretched too long, Evan added, “College is about relationships, having fun, trying new things.”
Sarah resisted, but the inner argument she was having with herself was evident in the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes. &quot;I made a plan that makes sense, and I’ve held to it for three years.”
“Doesn’t it make sense to enjoy your college life? To be well-rounded? To pursue new relationships?” Evan countered.
Sarah was exasperated. She wasn’t used to someone challenging her perspective so effectively. “You’ve got my head spinning. It doesn’t help that every time you kiss me, my IQ drops 50 points. How can my plan make so much sense, yet your opposite approach makes sense too?”
His next words caught her off guard. &quot;How can a piece of paper be both thin and wide?”
Before she could formulate an answer, Evan leaned in to kiss her again. The taste of his kiss was sweet and confusing, a turmoil of emotions, leaving her breathless. Pulling back, Evan proposed again. “Thursday night, dinner at seven at the Thai Garden?&quot;
After a moment of hesitance, she relented. &quot;Alright, I’ll meet you there at seven.”
Evan's joy was infectious as he clapped his hands together. “That’s awesome! Can I get your phone number? Your last name?”
&quot;Let’s wait and see how it goes,&quot; Sarah replied cautiously.
He nodded, accepting her boundaries. As she turned to leave, he extended his hand. “May I walk you to your car?”
The walk was silent, their hands intertwined, a silent promise of what was to come. When they reached her car, Evan leaned in, hopeful. “May I get a kiss goodbye?”
“Of course.” She answered, her breath steadier now.
The kiss was long and tender, filled with promises of the potential for something more. Pulling away, Evan teased, “How’s that IQ doing?”
Sarah responded with an unusual attempt at humor. “2+2 equals 10.”
Laughter filled the air, a comforting and intimate sound. When it finally faded, Evan's eyes held a hint of concern. “I’m afraid to let you go. I’m worried you won’t show up on Thursday.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. I never break an appointment unless it’s an emergency.” Sarah's voice was steady, and Evan could see the resolve in her eyes, a promise of the adventure to come.</Text>

Current residence: Seattle, Washington
Vehicle Driven: Mercedes-Benz
Resembles: Actor Meryl Streep
Eye Color: Blue
Hair Color: Gray
Height: 5’6”

Relationships: Wife to Jack Wilkins. Mother of Sarah Wilkins.
Personality traits: 
In terms of brand archetypes, her would be considered a Caregiver.
Her Myers-Briggs archetype is INFJ.
Notes:
Born in central Illinois.
She met Jack in high school when she was a junior, and he was a senior.
She worked various low-paying jobs while Jack attended a nearby college.
They were married shortly after he graduated.
Mildred was a dutiful wife to an authoritative husband.
She was not in any way abused; Jack treated her well. It's just that he was the primary decision-maker on any critical decisions. Mildred and Jack were rarely out of sync, regardless of who made the decision.
She eventually became an assistant office manager, where Jack worked after college.
After a few years, Jack was ready to start his own company, and Mildred followed him. She worked almost as many hours as Jack doing whatever needed, from cleaning the office to managing the books.
The company grew quickly, and shortly after that, Sarah was born. Once Sarah was born, Mildred voted to be a mother and wife.
Mildred was a tad more expressive than her husband or daughter and often felt like a third wheel. That being said, she was fulfilled by her role as mother and wife and had no desire to return to the corporate world. She enjoyed her life after Sarah was born.
When there were times that she disagreed with Jack's decision, especially about Sarah's upbringing, she would speak up. However, if Jack pushed back, Mildred would bite her tongue and acquiesce.

Character Description: 
In her mid-60s, Mildred Wilkins exudes a quiet, dignified grace. Her eyes, a vibrant blue, mirror those of her husband, Jack, and their only child, Sarah. She possesses a slim figure, standing at a modest 5'6&quot;, and carries herself with an air of serene confidence. 
Born and raised in Central Illinois, Mildred's life took a significant turn when she met Jack during her junior year of high school. The pair were inseparable from then on. Even as Jack progressed through college, Mildred stood by him, juggling various low-paying jobs to support their budding relationship. Their bond solidified when they got married shortly after Jack's graduation.
Mildred was a steadfast companion to her authoritative husband, Jack. Their dynamic was harmonious, even though Jack predominantly held the reins of decision-making. Jack treated her with respect and kindness, never overstepping the boundaries into mistreatment or abuse.
Following Jack into the corporate world, Mildred worked alongside him in various roles, from office cleaning to bookkeeping. She proved herself to be versatile, a characteristic that would serve her well when they embarked on the journey of starting their own company.
The birth of Sarah ushered in a new chapter in Mildred's life. She chose to step back from the corporate world, dedicating herself to the roles of mother and wife. Though she occasionally felt like a third wheel in the intellectually intense dynamics between Jack and Sarah, she found fulfillment in her chosen path.
Mildred's personality was a tad more expressive than her husband's or her daughter's. When she disagreed with Jack's decisions, especially concerning Sarah's upbringing, she wasn't afraid to voice her concerns. But when met with resistance, she would often yield, valuing harmony over conflict. Nonetheless, her influence was a gentle but firm grounding force in their family life, providing a balance to Jack's authoritative stance and Sarah's ambition. Mildred loved her life and cherished her role as a loving mother and a supportive wife.</Text>

            <Notes>Plot Summary:
For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his saint of her sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy.
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments.
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz.
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds,  listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally.
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything.
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
`Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls.
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs.
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss.
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire.
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career.
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age.
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number.
A week later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself.
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break.
At the food court., Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car.
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment.
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews.
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart.
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class.
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan.
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss.
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel.
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit.
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him.
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals.
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago.
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person.
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle.
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s close bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan.
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.</Notes>

To him, rejection is just part of the game. Guido presents himself as &quot;the bad boy.&quot; He often refers to his bad boy image as &quot;The Guido.&quot; He hypothesizes that most women need to sleep with at least one &quot;bad boy&quot; before they marry &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; As &quot;The Guido,&quot; he is happy to fulfill the role of the &quot;bad boy&quot; guilty pleasure that he believes women need to experience at least once in their life.

Sequence of Events:
After kissing the woman of his dreams, just to see her bolt into the unknown, Evan saw no point in going into the undergrad library to study. All he could think about was Sarah.
Evan decided to remain near the scene of their first kiss, hoping she would return to retrieve her broken glasses or, even better, return to see him.
This scene has Evan pacing back and forth and anxiously hoping, praying for Sarah to return.
Have Evan walk over to view the Morrow Plots to pass the time, but he never strayed too long for fear he would miss her return.
After an hour with no Sarah to be seen, Evan decided he would fix her glasses and return to the scene of the kiss tomorrow at the same time he first met her.
He hoped that she would have the same plan or that her schedule would be consistent and at the same spot the next day.
Wanting to tell Guido all about his experience with Sarah, Evan walked over to The Quad.
No surprise to Evan; Guido is hitting on two sophomore coeds. When it comes to women, it's a numbers game with Guido. Those two girls were his fifth and sixth attempts of the day.
Evan grabbed Guido by the shirt and pulled him away from the girls. The girls laughed as they continued on their way.
Evan: &quot;I gotta tell you something!&quot;
Guido:  &quot;Hey, Man! Why'd you  do that?&quot; He continued in full bravado. &quot;I had those two in the palm of my hand.&quot;
Of course, Guido did not have the two girls in the palms of his hand. 
Evan: &quot;You did not. Never mind about that. I got something to tell you!&quot;
Guido dons a confused look on his face waiting for Evan to share his news.
Evan: &quot;I just kissed the most beautiful, amazing, wonderful woman in the world!&quot;
A skeptical Guido  replied mildly sarcastically, &quot;Sure you did.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I did, Guido! I am telling you I did.&quot;
Guido: “Where is she? What's her name?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't know. She ran off before I could get her name and number.&quot;
Guido: &quot;You're just fucking with me. You know everyone on campus.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm telling you the truth.&quot; Evan showed Guido Sarah's damaged eyeglasses. &quot;Here's proof. She left these behind. They fell off when we kissed.&quot;
Guido: &quot;That must've been one hell of a kiss!&quot;
Evan: &quot;It was! We kissed before we even spoke one word to each other.&quot; Evan paused and looked at the glasses, &quot;I think I will call her Cinderella. Instead of leaving a glass slipper, she left eyeglasses.&quot;
Guido was surprised. &quot;You kissed a girl seconds after meeting her? That's not like you, bro.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I couldn't help it. The Universe dropped her on my lap, and I had to go for it.&quot;
Guido: &quot;What are you gonna do now?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I am going to fix her glasses and try to find her tomorrow. Do you have an eyeglass repair kit?&quot;
Guido looked at Evan like he was nuts and said sarcastically. &quot;Sure, I got one in my back pocket.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I should be able to find one at the mall. You want to come with?&quot;
Guido: &quot;Nah, I see a lonely lady over there that looks like she needs a visit from 'The Guido.’&quot;
The scene ends with Evan headed off toward his car to drive to the mall. Try to find a way to keep the reader as vested as Evan was in anticipation of seeing Sarah the next day.</Text>

            <Text>As Katie was about to open her mouth to dive into another subject, the familiar buzz of her cell phone diverted her attention. She quickly glanced at the screen, her eyebrows arching slightly. &quot;Oh, it's Nicole, my hairstylist,&quot; she explained. &quot;She wants to confirm our appointment and she needs a picture of you to start making a plan for your makeover.&quot;
Sarah blinked in surprise but then smiled in response. &quot;Alright, let's do it.&quot;
Katie quickly captured a picture of Sarah, her fingers flying over the phone as she sent the image to Nicole. Within moments, Nicole responded with a flurry of excited emojis, already expressing her eagerness to work on Sarah's transformation. 
Katie asked, &quot;So altogether, including new clothes and hairstylist, what kind of budget are we talking?&quot; 
&quot;No budget constraints, you're in charge!&quot; Sarah said with a playful grin.
Katie's eyes lit up at this and she squealed, clapping her hands in excitement. &quot;Really? Oh, this is going to be so much fun!&quot;
The energy in the room was effervescent, reflecting off Sarah as her own excitement began to bubble up. It was new, this anticipation of a date, of being made over, of possibly breaking her own rules, but it was an invigorating feeling that Sarah welcomed.</Text>

            <Title>Tamora Pierce</Title>
            <Text>In the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the lives of two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, unfolded with divergent rhythms. 
Evan was a heart-throb, his athletic physique and charisma making him a beloved figure. Raised by his gentle-hearted sister Liz, he had learned to treat everyone with respect, whether they were a high-profile football captain or a humble water boy. But his academic skills didn't mirror his athletic prowess. He held no love for stuffy classrooms, preferring the call of the wild outdoors. But he'd promised Liz he'd aim for a GPA of 3.0 and he intended to keep his word. Hence, he turned his back on the free-spirited games with his friend Guido, immersing himself in study at the undergraduate library.
Sarah, conversely, was an academic luminary, her eyes set firmly on graduating as the class valedictorian. The library was her fortress, where she lost herself in intricate audio seminars and prepared for her teaching assistant role in a Business-101 class. A future CEO of her father's corporation, she had sworn off any romantic entanglements until she had her Master's degree in hand.
Destiny decided to interweave their lives when an engrossed Sarah, oblivious to her surroundings, nearly took a tumble down a wide flight of steps. Evan's quick reflexes saved the day, as he swept her up in a twirling dance move that culminated in a fiery, unexpected kiss. Flustered, Sarah fled, leaving her glasses behind.
Days later, Evan tracked her down, the repaired glasses meant as a charming gesture. In spite of her initial resistance, Sarah found herself yielding to his charm, and they agreed to meet in the food court. There, witnessing Evan's popularity, she doubted herself and the feasibility of their bond, leading her to flee again. Evan, however, wasn't one to be easily discouraged, and following another electrifying kiss, they agreed on a date.
In a twist of events, Sarah found herself relying on Katie Andrews, an earnest student from her class, to help her prepare for the date. With a modernized makeover, Sarah started reassessing her rigid resolution against college romances. If she was to step into this whirlwind, it would be with a well-laid plan, ensuring her academics wouldn't suffer.
Evan agreed to her terms. Ever since their first kiss, he'd been smitten, and now, they officially began their journey as a couple. Sarah slowly allowed herself to explore her dormant romantic side, while Evan improved academically under her guidance. Yet, while they relished the present, the future was a book unopened, Sarah undecided about attending an Ivy League school, and Evan, unbeknownst to her, planning a surprise proposal.
At their graduation party, Evan's proposal caught Sarah off-guard. Though her pragmatic side hesitated, her heart responded with a 'yes.' But her fears of disappointing her father, whom she had misled about the intensity of her relationship with Evan, lingered.
Her father presented her with a choice: follow Evan to Chicago while pursuing her Master's, or adhere to her initial plan. The repercussions of choosing Evan and a life in Chicago would result in the cessation of his financial aid. 
Now, Sarah was caught in a dilemma. She was aware of Evan's loyalty towards his sister and his potential job in Chicago, and she was unwilling to put her needs before his. Thus, she was left with a difficult decision: follow the path she had meticulously planned or give in to the unpredictable call of love. And when the time came, Sarah chose Evan, her heart finally outweighing her calculated judgments.</Text>

            <Title>Part 2: Katie can use the room</Title>
            <Text>
&quot;Wow, this place is amazing! How many bedrooms are there?&quot; The question resonated in the expansive space.
&quot;Two.&quot; Sarah's response came as a quiet murmur.
&quot;Is your roommate home?&quot; Katie inquired, her visual exploration of the apartment ongoing.
Sarah negated with a shake of her head. &quot;It’s just me. My father insisted I have an extra bedroom that I could use as an office. But I never use the guest room, I prefer to  work at the dining room table where I can spread out, or in my bedroom before I go to sleep.&quot;
The idea of privacy, the luxury of space, left Katie yearning. &quot;I can’t even imagine what it’s like not to have to share a room. Living in a tiny dorm room with a chatty roommate, makes it impossible to study.&quot;
An understanding hovered between them, thick and unspoken. As Katie's gaze made another sweep across the grand expanse of the apartment, Sarah seized the moment. With the effusive warmth of a mother granting her child a long-cherished wish, she said, &quot;You know, the guest room's always open if you ever need a quiet study sanctuary!&quot;
“Really! Thank you!&quot; With those words, Katie lunged forward and gave Sarah a big hug, the latter taken by surprise but welcoming the warmth.</Text>

POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Location: Guido's Car - Honda Civic
Tone: Celebratory, Anticipatory
Weather: Not relevant for this scene
Special Instructions: 
In the sequence of events section, I provide some ideas of what might be done and spoke. You have full discretion to write this scene the way you feel works best.
Sequence of Events:
The scene begins in Evan's and Guido's apartment. 
They are late for work. Evan needs to be there in time because he has a client session scheduled at 6 o'clock – his schedule start time is personal trainer.
Guido doesn't have anything until seven. He's taking even more time than usual in the bathroom making sure every air is in place. There is a new female personal trainer that we do want to impress.
Evan is anxious because he does will be late for his client session. More importantly, he wants Guido hurry up so he can tell Guido all about his day with Sarah. He knows there's no point in telling Guido when Guido's admiring himself in the mirror.
It's Guido's turn to drive today. On the ride to the gym Evan relives his experience with Sarah.
Guido listens to his friend is best he can, but he is a little concerned how obsessed Evan is with this girl. Guido's never seen obsessed with any girl. 
Evan is begging Guido for ideas on how to make the date special. Guido looks at his family's crazy. 
Guido: “How what I know what special is? Special to me is I spend the night.”
Just starts naming things anyone would think of. Candy, Flowers, A bottle of wine, lingerie
Evan keeps shooting down for one reason or another. Either the gift is cliché and not special enough, or it's not appropriate for first date.
Eventually Guido gets irritated and says, &quot;I don't know dude you're asking the wrong guy. Get your act together dude, or she is going to ditch you 10 minutes into the date. You better play cool like ‘The Guido’”
Evan acknowledges that Guido has somewhat of a point. He is acting hyper enthusiastic. 
Guido said, &quot;Look bro, I'm glad you got a date with this girl. But from what I hear, he's a bit mature for her age.&quot; 
Evan asked what does that that even mean. 
Guido tells him it means she wants a cool sophisticated dude. You better get your act together before Thursday.
Guido continues. Rumor is she is some sort of high-class society girl that wouldn’t give the college the time of day. I hear she only dates older men–
Evan interrupted, that's not true–
Guido interrupts back. It doesn't matter dude. She's clearly not like the girls you I are used to hanging out with. If you want to get her something special, then you gotta realize what special her like a Gucci purse, or expensive shoes, or jewelry –
[[ Guido pulls into the gym ]]
[[Evan interrupts Guido after he says jewelry. ]]
That's it! You're a genius, dude.
[[Words Guido loves to hear]]
Guido asks what are you going to get her?
[[They get out of the car and head to the entrance of the gym]]
Evan says, I don't know. I'll go to the mall tomorrow and look for inspiration. 
[[ scene ends ]]

1.	The scene starts with Sarah emerging from the library with her earbuds in her ears. Use the location profile of &quot;Outside of the Undergrad Library&quot; to describe the area outside the library doors.
2.	Her pace was fast because she was in a bit of a panic about being late for class.
3.	Her mind was preoccupied with concerns about tardiness and the voice coming through her earbuds.
4.	Evan had never met Sarah. 
5.	He saw she was not paying attention and was only a few feet away from the concrete stairs with no railing.
6.	He called out to warn her. He shouted, “Hey, lady in the skirt suit!&quot; Everyone heard him except the lady in the skirt suit.
7.	He didn't know if he could make it, but he took off at high speed to try and stop her before she fell on the concrete stairs with no railing.
8.	He caught her just in time, but the momentum of her fast pace caused her body to swing around as if they were dancing and he was dipping her.
9.	Her briefcase, purse, and their contents flew in all directions. Her eyeglasses fell to the ground.
11. The barrette that loosely held her hair in an updo fell out, causing her long hair to barely touch the ground as she fell backward.
12.	She found herself leaning back almost parallel to the ground.
13.	They gazed longingly at each other. 
14.	Evan told Sarah, &quot;I feel like I should kiss you.&quot; Caught in the moment, Sarah smiled and uncharacteristically said, &quot;I’m not going to stop you.&quot; 
15.	They shared a deep passionate kiss. After the kiss, Evan lifted Sarah back to her feet.
16.	She remembered how late she was and frantically gathered her belongings with Evan's assistance.

18.	Out of sorts, she responded, &quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot;

20.	Sarah was too out of sorts to recognize she brought unintended humor to this romantically charged moment.
21.	She took off without sharing her name or phone number, unknowingly leaving her broken glasses behind. Note: the lenses weren't broken, just the hinge on one of the arms.
22.	Evan picked up her glasses and held them high in the air as he called out to her. Either she didn't hear him, or she didn't want to respond, as she kept running.
23. With Sarah's glasses in hand and a lighthearted grin on his face, Evan watched her disappear into the distance, leaving behind a whirlwind of emotions and a promise of a future encounter he knew was meant to be.

            <Text>Name of the place: Sarah's Apartment
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign
Type of place: Apartment
How does the setting affect the characters and the plot? 
Two scenes take place at this location. First is when Katie helps Sarah get ready for her date with Evan. The second is when Sarah returns home from her date with Evan.
Sarah struggles to bond with other college students. However, Katie and Sarah develop a bond at the apartment. Sarah even offers the use of her guest bedroom to Katie when she needs alone time to study.
Description: 
Sarah's apartment is a testament to modern luxury, situated on the top floor of a relatively new six-story student housing complex. The building, less than three years old, exudes a contemporary charm, with its sleek exterior design and high-end amenities.
Her father, ever the generous provider, had secured for her a two-bedroom apartment, one of which she could utilize as an office. However, true to her workaholic nature, Sarah found more comfort working in the same room she slept in. 
Stepping inside the apartment, one is immediately struck by the immaculate cleanliness. The open concept living area is crisply kept, filled with minimalist furniture in subtle hues. Floor-to-ceiling windows line one side of the living room, allowing ample natural light to fill the space while providing breathtaking views of the city below. 
The kitchen area is equally impressive, complete with top-of-the-line stainless steel appliances, a marble countertop, and stylish cabinetry. Despite the well-equipped kitchen, the lack of use indicates Sarah's preference for take-out or on-campus meals over cooking. 
Sarah's bedroom doubles as her workspace, holding a luxurious bed with a stylishly austere frame and an ergonomic desk cluttered with papers, textbooks, and a high-end laptop. The room feels lived in but organized, an oasis of personal space in her otherwise untouched apartment.
The guest bedroom, by contrast, remains pristine and scarcely used. The perfectly made bed, devoid of wrinkles, and the dustless surfaces create an atmosphere of a high-end hotel room, awaiting its first guest. Despite its emptiness, the room is prepared with all the essentials, standing as a silent testament to Sarah's meticulous and organized nature.
Overall, Sarah's apartment reflects her personality – ambitious, detail-oriented, and somewhat reserved, providing a space that's more functional than personal. Despite the apartment's capacity for hosting and socialization, it remains primarily a sanctuary for Sarah, a place of quiet solitude and diligent work.</Text>
            <Notes>Please provide me with a description for Sarah's apartment. Here are some details:
* Sarah's wealthy father paid for Luxury Student Housing.
* She is on the top floor of a six-story building.
* The building is less than three years old.
* Her father got her a two bedroom apartment so that she could have one bedroom as her office.
* Being the workaholic that Sarah is, she just prefers to work in the bedroom she sleeps in.
* Sarah keeps the apartment crisp and clean.
* The guest bedroom looks as though it's never been used.</Notes>

            <Title>0165 Sarah Updates Katie</Title>
            <Synopsis>After a magical first date, Sarah returns to her apartment to share the evening events with Katie. Katie and Sarah are excited to see that Evan has requested that he and Sarah change their Facebook status to “In a Relationship.”</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah entered her apartment and closed the door behind her, a mixture of emotions swirling within her like a storm. She leaned back against the door and released a long sigh, feeling as if she were floating on a cloud. The evening's events had left her vibrating with excitement, a sense of relief washing over her like a gentle wave. The experience had been nothing short of orgasmic, leaving her weightless in its wake.
Katie's voice cut through her thoughts, pulling her back to the present. &quot;I am guessing by the look on your face that the date went well?&quot; Her eyes sparkled with a mixture of hope and curiosity.
Sarah's lips curled into a radiant smile as she met Katie's gaze. &quot;It was perfect.&quot;
Katie's own excitement was palpable as she jumped up and down, embracing Sarah in a tight hug. Her voice trembled with genuine happiness as she exclaimed, &quot;I’m so happy for you, Sarah. Come sit down, let’s talk.&quot;
Sarah followed Katie to the couch, settling in as she held out the pendant for her friend to see. &quot;Evan calls me his Cinderella because I’m always trying to run away from him like it’s midnight.&quot;
With a knowing smile, Sarah shared the story behind the necklace, the sentiment and thoughtfulness that Evan had poured into its creation. As she spoke, she felt a tear well up in her eye, the emotions of the moment overwhelming her once again.
Katie's voice was soft as she responded, her eyes shining with empathy and a touch of envy. &quot;Oh, Sarah, that’s so romantic. I swear you are the luckiest woman I know.&quot;
Sarah's heart swelled with joy, her fingers tracing the delicate pendant as she replied, &quot;I feel like the luckiest woman alive.&quot;
A gentle buzz from her phone drew her attention to a Facebook message. She pulled it up to reveal a relationship request from Evan. A mix of nerves and excitement coursed through her as she showed it to Katie.
&quot;Evan wants me to confirm that we’re in a relationship,&quot; she explained.
Katie's question was straightforward, her curiosity evident, but her voice carried a note of seriousness. &quot;Are you in a relationship?&quot;
Sarah's smile spoke volumes as she nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot;
Katie playfully raised an eyebrow, a teasing glint in her eye. &quot;Wow, you move fast! Are you going to confirm it?&quot;
Sarah's response was filled with genuine enthusiasm. &quot;I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to do anything more in my life.&quot;
With a simple tap on the screen, she confirmed the relationship on Facebook, solidifying the connection she had already felt in her heart.
Katie's words were filled with warmth, her face reflecting the affection she felt for her friend as she watched her friend's radiant glow. &quot;I can’t wait for all the details. You are glowing!&quot;
Sarah's laughter was like music, a reflection of the happiness bubbling within her. &quot;I feel incredible, Katie! In a single day, I have an amazing new friend and an amazing new boyfriend. For the first time, I feel like a normal woman.&quot;
As she spoke, a surge of emotion coursed through her, and she couldn't help but thrust back against the cushion in sheer jubilation, her excitement practically tangible.
&quot;Katie, I had no idea it would feel this good.&quot; Her heart soared as she basked in the glow of newfound emotions. Sarah thought, _In the past, I might have scoffed at girls gushing over boys and talking endlessly about romantic feelings. But now, I finally understand. I know what it's like to be kissed romantically, to feel this rush of emotion and connection. And in this moment, I wouldn't trade it for anything.
In that moment, Sarah let go of her rational thoughts, surrendering to the overwhelming surge of feelings that enveloped her. She reveled in the sensation of being a &quot;normal woman,&quot; embracing the intoxicating journey she had embarked upon with Evan.</Text>

            <Text>NOVEL FORMAT
About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

            <Title>0120 Waiting Game</Title>
            <Synopsis>The day after the Kiss, Evan waited where they kissed, hoping Sarah would return.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0120 Waiting Game
Characters: Evan, Guido
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Time of Day: Morning
Locations: Outside the entrance doors to the undergrad library. The area at and around the spot where Evan and Sarah first kissed.
Tone: The scene starts with Evan hopeful. But as the rain began to drizzle down on him, Evan watched hundreds of people come in and out of the library, none of them being Sarah. With no sight of her, he gradually got sadder and sadder.
Guido came to check on him and successfully got Evan to stop torturing himself at that location and head back to their apartment. 
Guido was also able to instill a bit of hope in Evan.
The scene does a full circle when it comes to Tone. The scene starts with hope,  turns to disappointment, sadness, and then despair before returning to a muted version of hope.
Weather: Cloudy, drizzly
Special Instructions: 
Since there is no dialogue in the first part of this scene, focus on Evan's thoughts and feelings as his emotions roller coaster at first before heading down a steep decline until Guido arrived. I really want the reader to suffer along with Evan. Integrating the increasingly gloomy weather and aligning it with his mood deterioration is essential to help the reader visualize Evans suffering.
Although Guido was not considered a nurturing or compassionate human being, I would like the reader to see he does have a caring side, even if his method of expressing that care is not typical of what others might do.
Even though Guido doesn't really understand why Evan is so distressed, he wanted to be there for his best friend in whatever way he could. 
The dialogue and narratives I have provided may be used as is or changed at your discretion.
Understanding the precise spot where Evan and Sarah had their first kiss is essential. The kiss happened outside in an open, uncovered area on four concrete stairs leading downward from a flat platform. Evan had saved her from a fall, leading to a passionate kiss. The actual spot where they kissed was at least 30 feet from the library entrance.
In the scene, I don't want the reader to think that Evan is stood right in front of the library doors watching people come and go. In his 2-hour wait, Evan shifts from place to place but never gets too close to the kissing spot or the library entry and exit doors. He is always at least 20 are 30 feet away. I don't want the reader to think Evan is overly pathetic or so desperate that he must stand just 2 feet from the kissing spot or the library entrance doors.
This scene takes place on a Friday, the day after the kiss, at the same time as the kiss.
Sequence of Events:
Evan returned to the location where he and Sarah first kissed. He was feeling hopeful, but his hope was diminished a bit, still feeling the disappointment from her not returning to this spot the day before. 
His excitement with yo-yo every time he caught a glimpse of blonde hair in his periphery. Every time the door to the undergrad library opened, his heart would skip a beat, thinking it would be her. But she was nowhere to be found.
As time rolled by, the rain rolled in. It started drizzling about half an hour into his wait and continually worsened for another 90 minutes. Evan was worried that if she didn't show, he would have to wait an entire weekend to try again. He knew that weekend would feel like an eternity.
Evan had a jacket on but didn't think to bring an umbrella. He did his best to find trees and awnings to stand under to help keep him dry. But he refused to pick any spot that didn't give him a direct view of the library doors and the place where he and Sarah first kissed—his effort to remain dry produced minimal results.
After Evan had been there a couple of hours, Guido came to check on him.
Guido: &quot;No Luck?”
Evan looked dejected. With his head down, he said, &quot;No, I haven't seen her.&quot;
Guido provided his version of consolation, &quot;Sorry, bro. Don't stress it. There are plenty of fish in the sea.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't want to fish in the sea. She's the only one for me.&quot;
Guido: &quot;I don't get you, bro. You got women lined up to be with you, and you're stressing over a girl whose name you don't know? You should adopt my style – no strings attached, no drama.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Yeah, and no hope for love.&quot;
In a way, Guido admired Evan. Guido chuckled. &quot;My friend, ever the hopeless romantic.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm just... I'm just...just…&quot; Evan couldn't find the words to express his sentiment. Frustrated, he said, &quot;I don't know what I am. I just know that I have to see my Cinderella again.&quot;
Guido felt for Evan. Guido joked. &quot;Let's leave the matching glass slipper search for another day. Come on, let's head back to our place. We’ll knock down a few beers and watch baseball. The Cubs actually have a chance for the playoffs this year!&quot;
Evan remained silent but didn't appear ready to go with Guido.
Guido gently persisted. &quot;You'll feel a lot better with a cold brew in your hand and a Cubs victory on the TV. I’ll tell you what, after the game, we’ll try to figure a way to get her name.&quot;
Evan, still silent, was not yet persuaded.
Guido joked, &quot;How hard can it be to find the most beautiful girl on campus?&quot;
Guido's words brought a small smile to Evan's face. 
 Evan: &quot;I suppose you're right. I'll bump into her sooner or later.&quot;
Guido: &quot;Exactly! Let's chill at home, and we’ll scour the Internet when the game ends.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Thanks, dude. I feel better already.&quot;
Nothing more was said as they headed home. The scene ends here. I want the reader to feel Evan's contrasting motions of disappointment that he didn't see Sarah and hope that inevitably he'll find his way to her.&quot;

            <Title>Shear Elegance Hair Salon</Title>
            <Text>Name of the place: Shear Elegance
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign
Type of place: Hair salon
What role does this setting play in the story? 
This venue is the chic salon where Sarah undergoes a contemporary hair transformation. Even though Sarah's hair is already gorgeous, Nicole, the expert hairstylist, opts to infuse it with subtle lowlights, adding depth to her light blonde locks. Simultaneously, she trims a few inches off, maintaining the hair's overall length but refreshing its look.
In the midst of this protracted styling session, the salon evolves into a space of revelation and burgeoning anticipation. The intimate atmosphere, punctuated by the hum of hairdryers and the gentle clatter of hairstyling tools, lends itself to confessions about Sarah's somewhat sparse romantic past. The air practically thrums with a sense of expectation as Sarah contemplates violating her self-imposed dating moratorium and potentially embarking on a relationship with Evan.
Description: 
Tucked away in the heart of a vibrant central Illinois lies an unassuming, yet undeniably modern hair salon. Through the large glass facade, the salon's chic and bustling atmosphere beckons to both casual passersby and dedicated customers alike.
Upon crossing the threshold, visitors are met with an airy, open space, replete with the gentle hum of hairdryers, the soft rustle of foil, and the low murmur of friendly conversation. The flooring is a modern marvel, laid out with sleek, polished wooden planks that lend a warm, contemporary touch to the space.
To the right of the entrance, an intimate seating area is neatly arranged. An elegant, tufted couch in a muted gray is flanked by a pair of sleek armchairs. Placed strategically, this area allows Katie to comfortably observe the transformation process from her seat, keeping a watchful eye on Sarah as Nicole works her magic.
Running parallel to the left wall are several state-of-the-art hairstyling stations. Each boasts a large, backlit mirror framed by brushed steel, and a swivel chair upholstered in rich, black leather. Mobile carts filled with an array of high-end hair care products and advanced tools are stationed conveniently next to each chair.
Nicole tends to Sarah at the third station from the entrance, providing a perfect line of sight to Katie from the reflective mirror. The overall lighting is artfully designed to cast an inviting glow over the area, highlighting the natural finishes of the wooden floor and the sophisticated furnishings.
Adding a touch of biophilia, strategically placed potted plants bring a sense of calm and vitality to the salon. The back wall serves as a stylish product display, with lit glass shelves housing an impressive range of premium hair care products and styling tools.
Tucked in the back corner of the salon, a glass partition subtly separates the wash station from the main area. Here, plush, reclining chairs face ceramic sinks, each equipped with modern showerheads, providing a comfortable and relaxing hair-washing experience for clients.
With its soft background music and contemporary aesthetic, this small-town salon rivals its big-city counterparts, promising clients not just a hairstyling appointment, but a luxury experience that caters to their modern tastes.</Text>
