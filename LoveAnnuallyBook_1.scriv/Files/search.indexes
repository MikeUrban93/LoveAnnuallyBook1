            <Synopsis>For a second time, Evan returns to the scene of the kiss, looking for Sarah. He decides to look in the library, where he finds Sarah.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Name: 0125 Evan Finds Sarah at the Library
With a vibrant spring day as his backdrop, Evan Vaughn stepped into the bustling library, the scent of ink and parchment wafting around him. His eyes, as bright as the afternoon sun outside, began a meticulous search for the face he'd not been able to forget.
His heart throbbed with anticipation, a buoyant rhythm that pounded a familiar mantra, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah. He scrutinized the sea of faces, squinting at figures in the distance. That was when he spotted the tail end of a blonde ponytail bobbing above a sea of bent heads. There she was, her long hair drawn back, and her posture as professional as her skirt suit.
His approach was as inevitable as the sunrise. He watched as Sarah's eyes, seemingly drawn to his magnetic presence, widened in surprise before hiding behind a thick volume she held aloft.
A playful smirk teased the corners of Evan's lips. He moved with unhurried grace, sliding into the chair opposite Sarah. As he proffered the glasses he'd meticulously repaired, he held her captive gaze. With a nod of her head, and her pulse hammering an erratic beat, he swapped her glasses.
Their repartee was a dance. Evan led, deftly twirling her words and spinning them into laughter. The charm and charisma that radiated from him found its match in Sarah's reticence. Yet, her reluctance was a subtle music that thrummed in the background, providing a counterpoint to their lively discourse.
From the playful reading of a book upside down to the shared laughter over his supposed love for 19th-century female poets, Evan courted her resistance, chipping away at her resolve with an irresistible blend of humor and sincerity. Each smile he pulled from her, each bout of laughter, felt like a victory.
And then, weaving their shared memories into a whimsical tale, he flung down his gauntlet. His eyes sparkled as he narrated a make-believe poem called The Kiss. A poem that echoed their story, their magical, stolen kiss, and the electrifying chase that followed. 
&quot;Does it end in a happily ever after?&quot; Sarah's voice was soft, vulnerable. 
Evan leaned in, his gaze warm. &quot;But of course!&quot;
His easy banter resumed, his voice modulating into a comical imitation of a literature professor, analyzing poetry with exaggerated profundity. Even as Sarah tried to regain focus on her books, he continued his good-natured onslaught.
&quot;Will you keep annoying me until I agree to accompany you?&quot; Sarah asked, her eyes shimmering with mirth.
&quot;Annoying?&quot; Evan feigned shock. &quot;I was aiming for charming.&quot;
Sarah's laughter, clear and ringing, echoed around them. &quot;Okay, fine, annoyingly charming.&quot; 
Evan's tone softened, his words growing sincere. He appealed to the memory of their shared kiss, a moment etched in his heart, asking for a mere fifteen minutes of her time. His plea was genuine, his hope evident.
After a heart-stopping pause, Sarah packed up her belongings, her acquiescence silent but clear.
As they departed, Evan held the door open for her, his actions ever the gentleman's. A spring breeze rushed in as they stepped outside, its cool fingers teasing the ends of Sarah's ponytail. 
As the door closed behind them, the library seemed to hush, the silence speaking volumes of the magnetic bond that had just begun to form.
Author's Style: Romantic Comedy with an overlay of intense and passionate emotions. The interplay of wit and charm against a backdrop of strong emotional undercurrents is reminiscent of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.

            <Title>0110 Evan And Sarah Kiss</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan sees Sarah, a woman he has never met, headed for disaster in the form of concrete steps. He rushes to save her from a dangerous fall, and in the process, they share a kiss.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah burst out from the library, her earbuds plugged in, humming a tune against the pulse of her frantic heartbeat. The sun gleamed on the imposing facade of the Undergrad Library, its shadow stretched over the vast concrete expanse, a staircase carving its way through. The steps, devoid of railings, dropped like a challenge, a trap for those lost in thoughts and not in step with their surroundings. 

Evan was there, observing from a distance, his eyes following this hurried woman who seemed so engrossed in her world that the reality of the treacherous stairs eluded her. He had never seen her before. She was a stranger, yet something within him stirred. An impromptu hero for the lady in the skirt suit who, he suspected, was about to tumble down the stairs. &quot;Hey, lady in the skirt suit!&quot; he bellowed. The call echoed, turning heads, but not the one it intended to reach. 

With a leap of faith, he sprinted towards her, his heart pounding against his ribs, each step fueled by a desperate need to avert the impending accident. He reached her just as she stepped into the air above the stairs, catching her in a saving grasp. The force of her pace turned their collision into an impromptu dance, her body swaying around in his grip, a briefcase, a purse, papers, a spectacle flying as if an invisible audience had just applauded their performance. 

She found herself dipped back, held securely in his arms, her face tilted upward. Her glasses and barrette fell away, revealing a youthful face that contradicted her professional attire. For a moment, Evan was lost in her eyes, the world around them blurring into irrelevance. 

&quot;I feel like I should kiss you,&quot; he murmured, pulling her closer. She met his gaze, a soft smile curving her lips, &quot;I am not going to stop you.&quot; Their lips met in a passionate exchange that seemed to freeze time, their world reduced to the feel of each other's lips.

Evan helped Sarah to her feet after their impromptu kiss. Reality seemed to surge back with full force as she noticed the scattered remnants of her belongings. She panicked, scampering to gather her things, aided by Evan. He asked for her name, to which she responded, flustered, &quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot;

Evan chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. &quot;That's a strange name.&quot;

She missed the jest, her mind too preoccupied. With one last look at him, she darted away, leaving behind her broken glasses in her hasty exit. Evan picked them up, waving them high in the air as he called out for her, but she was already gone. The thought of chasing her flashed in his mind but quickly receded. A man chasing a woman across a college campus? That wouldn't be a good look. 

So, with a chuckle and her glasses in his hand, he watched her disappearing figure. The day was still sunny, the scene outside the library returning to its usual hustle, but for Evan, the air felt charged with the promise of something more.

            <Title>Nicholas Sparks</Title>
            <Text>Set amidst the beautiful backdrop of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the narrative introduces Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, two distinct souls on the verge of destiny. As their senior year begins, life proceeds as it always has. They are strangers, moving in different circles, unaware that fate will soon interweave their stories.
Evan, blessed with striking good looks and a compelling aura, is the center of attention on campus. Yet, his popularity doesn’t stem from vanity, but rather a genuine, likable personality that effortlessly attracts others, a quality cultivated by his kind-hearted sister, Liz. His academic prowess, however, doesn’t quite match his social skills. Not due to a lack of capability, but a preference for the liberating outdoors over confined classrooms. Despite this, he is committed to achieving a 3.0 GPA, a promise made to Liz that he intends to keep. Thus, he reluctantly trades time spent in nature for studying, hoping to uphold his promise.
Sarah, conversely, embodies academic excellence. A prospective business major and the heart of the university library, she is determined to graduate top of her class. Lost in an audio seminar one day, she abruptly realizes she is about to be late for a class she teaches. In her hurry to exit the library, she remains oblivious to the descending staircase just outside the door.
Noticing Sarah’s impending fall, Evan leaps into action. His warnings go unheard due to her earbuds, leaving him no choice but to dart toward her, intercepting her just in time. The ensuing spontaneous kiss shared in the aftermath of this dramatic event leaves an indelible mark on their hearts, igniting a flame they never knew existed.
Despite this unexpected turn of events, Sarah struggles to balance her newfound emotions with her ambitious plans to succeed her father in their family business. Having made a promise to both herself and her father to steer clear of romantic distractions until after her graduation, she finds herself in a predicament.
Even so, Evan's charm and the chemistry between them proves too strong to resist. When he returns her forgotten glasses, Sarah finally succumbs to his persistence, agreeing to a date. Their relationship blossoms, albeit with Sarah setting clear expectations to ensure her academic aspirations remain undeterred. Evan, captivated by Sarah, readily agrees to these conditions.
Their shared senior year becomes a transformative journey. Sarah discovers a new side of her personality as she learns to navigate social engagements, while Evan, with Sarah's guidance, sees a marked improvement in his academics. But as graduation nears, uncertainty begins to cloud Sarah's mind.
Unknown to Sarah, Evan is planning a proposal. During their graduation party, in the presence of their friends and a surprise appearance from her parents, Evan proposes. Caught off guard, Sarah accepts, much to her parents' surprise as she had previously downplayed the intensity of their relationship.
Her father, a man of rationality and fairness, offers her a choice - to pursue a future with Evan in Chicago without his financial support, or to stick to her initial plan of achieving her Masters and joining him in Seattle. Faced with this dilemma, Sarah must decide between her long-standing ambitions and her heart's yearning for Evan.
In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, this tale of love and self-discovery explores the poignant moments of life-changing decisions. Despite the odds, it is Sarah's heart that prevails, choosing a future with Evan in Chicago over her original academic plan. This is a testament to the power of love and its ability to reshape lives, a familiar theme in Sparks' emotional narratives.</Text>

            <Text>Location Profile: 
Name of the place: Penthouse Suite at Champaign Hotel
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign
Type of place: Hotel suite
What role does this setting play in the story?
The Penthouse Suite in the Champaign Hotel serves as the quiet sanctuary where Sarah and her parents retreat after the exuberance of the graduation party and Evan's surprise proposal. This private space, away from the noise and crowd of the party, provides the perfect backdrop for a family discussion about Sarah's future. As the night fades into the early hours of morning, emotions are unveiled, truths are spoken, and decisions are made. The gravity of the situation stands in stark contrast with the calm elegance of the suite, and what unfolds within these walls is a turning point in Sarah's life.
Description:
Sitting on the top floor of the Champaign Hotel, the Penthouse Suite provides a spectacular view of the city skyline. The sprawling suite opens up into a spacious living room. The floor-to-ceiling windows cover the entirety of one wall, allowing the shimmering city lights to flood the room and cast a soft glow over the polished wooden floor. 
The tasteful decor features a neutral palette, with contrasting elements of dark wood furniture and plush, cream-colored upholstery. A large, comfortable sectional sofa occupies one corner of the room, paired with a glass coffee table and a couple of elegant armchairs, providing a comfortable setting for the family discussion.
Off to one side, a small dining area is neatly set up, complete with a modern dining table and six chairs. Beyond the dining area, a well-equipped kitchenette is visible, complete with high-end appliances and marble countertops. 
The bedroom, accessible via a short corridor, is a picture of cozy luxury. A king-size bed, covered with crisp white linens and fluffy pillows, invites rest and relaxation. Adjacent to the bed, a full-length window provides breathtaking views of the city's nightscape.
The suite exudes an air of serene sophistication, amplified by the tastefully selected artwork that adorns the walls. The entire atmosphere of the suite speaks of privacy and comfort, serving as the ideal location for an important family discussion about Sarah's future after a surprising and eventful evening.

            <Title>Undergrad Library</Title>
            <Text>Name of the place: Undergrad Library, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
Nickname: Undergrad Library
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign/Urbana
Type of place: Library
What role does this setting play in the story? 
Two scenes take place at this location. At the beginning of the story, this is where Sarah was when she realizes she was late for the class she was supposed to teach in her role as a teacher's assistant.
It plays a vital role because this is where Evan is headed to study extra to maintain a 3.0 GPA. He is on his way to the library, and she is rushing out. Shortly after she leaves the library, Evan saves her from a severe fall, and they kiss.
The second scene at this location is when Evan desperately wants to see the girl he kissed but has little information about. He gets the idea to check inside the library since that's where she came from on the day of the kiss. He finds her there and charms a reluctant Sarah into joining him at the food court.
Are there any unique or notable aspects of the setting? 
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's Undergraduate Library (UGL) is built underground due to a local ordinance at the time of its construction, in the late 1960s. This regulation stipulated that no structure could be erected that would cast a shadow on the Morrow Plots, an important agricultural research field located on campus.
The Morrow Plots were established in 1876 and are the oldest such experimental fields in the United States and the third oldest in the world. They have been used to develop new and improved methods of farming and to study the long-term impacts of various farming techniques on soil composition and crop yields.
To respect this historical site and adhere to the ordinance, the university decided to construct the Undergraduate Library underground, which allowed it to provide a large, modern library facility without casting a shadow on the Morrow Plots.
The UGL was specifically designed to cater to the needs of undergraduate students, with a wide array of resources and study spaces, and it quickly became a hub for student learning and collaboration. Its subterranean construction adds a unique touch to its importance as an academic institution
Notes: 
The undergraduate library was a flurry of activity and bright, relentless fluorescent lighting. Instead of a quiet sanctuary, it was a hub of engagement, a hive buzzing with the energy of youthful minds. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a stark, almost clinical glow over the rows of tables and chairs, making the room feel less like a typical library and more like a vibrant community center.
Groups of students huddled together at the tables, doing their best to keep their voices down but often failing in those efforts, as evidenced by scolded looks from others trying to study.
In corners and along the aisles between bookshelves, there were pockets of flirtation. Amidst the academic pursuit, the library also served as a social arena, a meeting point for like-minded individuals who could connect over shared study materials and the occasional whispered joke. A glance stolen across the study table, a shy smile in response to a witty remark, the quiet exchange of notes – these were as common in the library as textbooks and highlighters.
It was more than a library; it was a microcosm of college life, a blend of hard work, cooperation, and the undercurrent of budding romance. Students came for the books but stayed for the energy and camaraderie that hummed through the bright, lively room.
</Text>
            <Notes>You have previously given me a description of what the undergrad library environment would've been like. Please rewrite the description of that location using the following information:

The undergrad library's lighting was always very bright–fluorescent. That made it feel less calm than your description. Also, there was always a group or two of students studying together, talking in regular voices rather than hushed tones. Finally, it was common for people to go to the library to flirt with their crushes. Not sure how you capture that, though.</Notes>

            <Title>Suzanne Collins</Title>
            <Text>For Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, senior year at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign began as an ordinary semester, the two strangers running in distinct circles. 
Evan, known for his athletic prowess and magnetic personality, drew attention without effort, though never letting it cloud his judgement. Raised by his compassionate sister, Liz, Evan treated all with kindness, be it a football star or a shy water boy. However, the academia was never his strongest suit, not due to lack of intellect, but his love for the open air and disdain for classroom boundaries. Nonetheless, he had a promise to Liz: to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA. So he traded the thrill of Frisbee games for quietude in the library, much to his friend Guido's disappointment. 
In contrast, Sarah was a powerhouse student, her sights set on graduating top of her class. The library was her sanctuary, the site of countless hours spent on her audio seminars and preparation for the Business-101 class she taught. Her life was a race against the clock, meticulously planned, her only companion her relentless ambition. The daughter of a tycoon, she was destined to be the future CEO of her father's company. She believed in a life devoid of romantic involvements until her Masters' degree was in hand. 
As fate would have it, their paths crossed when Sarah, engrossed in her seminar, nearly tripped down a set of stairs. Evan, sensing danger, sprinted to her aid, saving her in a sweeping embrace that culminated in an unexpected, passionate kiss. After the startling interaction, Sarah fled the scene, leaving behind only her glasses.
Days later, Evan located Sarah and returned her glasses, now repaired. Despite her attempts to remain focused, Sarah found herself capitulating to his charm, agreeing to join him for a break in the food court. Confronted with his popularity and the stark contrast between their lives, Sarah fled again, only to be pursued by Evan. They shared another electrifying kiss and agreed on a date. 
In preparation, Sarah turned to Katie Andrews, a bright student from her class, who, along with her hairstylist friend, assisted in updating Sarah's appearance and fashion. While getting a makeover, Sarah found herself reconsidering her stringent policy against romantic engagements. If she were to venture into this territory, she decided, it would be under calculated terms, safeguarding her academic aspirations. 
Evan agreed to her rules, love-struck since their first interaction. Their relationship flourished, with Sarah embracing her dormant romantic side and Evan improving academically with Sarah's help. As they savored the present, they remained silent about their future, Sarah wavering over her decision to attend an Ivy League school, and Evan planning a surprise proposal at their graduation party. 
At the party, Evan's proposal shocked Sarah. All her rationality screamed 'no', but she found herself saying 'yes', too consumed by love to refuse. The consequence was a potentially disapproving encounter with her father, who she had deceived about the intensity of her relationship with Evan. 
Her father presented two options: follow Evan to Chicago and begin a life with him while continuing her Masters, or stick to her initial plan. He would not force her to end her engagement, but if she chose Evan over the family business, his financial support would cease. 
Sarah found herself torn. She knew Evan's commitment to his sister and his promising job opportunity in Chicago, and she felt guilty about asking him to wait for her. The choice was clear, yet difficult: follow her meticulously planned path or surrender to the unpredictable allure of love. Ultimately, against all odds, Sarah chose Evan, her heart triumphing over logic.</Text>
            <Notes>(Author's style: Suzanne Collins. Collins's style is characterized by her vivid and engaging descriptions, character-driven narratives, and her use of suspense. The scene captures these elements, using immersive description to paint a picture of the surroundings, and character-driven narrative to convey the inner thoughts and feelings of Evan. The anticipation of Sarah's possible return creates a sense of suspense throughout the scene.)

            <Synopsis>For a second time, Evan returns to the scene of the kiss, looking for Sarah. He decides to look in the library, where he finds Sarah.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0125 Evan Finds Sarah at the library
Characters: Evan, Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Locations: Outside the entrance doors to the undergrad library. The area at and around the spot where Evan and Sarah first kissed.
Tone: Sweet, cute, charming, playful
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
Although the weather is not apparent from underground, Evan just entered from outside and knew it was a perfect day. Feel free to have Evan use this information to persuade Sarah to take a break on a beautiful day and walk with him to the food court.
This is meant to be a high-energy, fun, and playful scene. After not seeing each other since the day of their kiss, the chemistry between them upon their second meeting is palpable.
While Sarah is still reluctant and somewhat resistant, Evan is all in. In this scene, we can see how Evan's charm and persistence will eventually shatter her resistance.
This is the third scene at this location, so we don't need to be overly descriptive of the setting—just small descriptions of their surroundings as required in the scene. 
Please make sure to include the dialogue and actions from scene elements 27 through 30 verbatim in all versions of this scene.
It's important to note that he still does not know Sarah's name, nor does she know his until the next scene.
Sequence of Events:
The scene begins with Evan walking into the library, his eyes scanning panoramically, seeking Sarah.
Evan was confident that close up, he could identify her. But he wasn’t sure he would recognize her from a distance. This became a moot point since only one student in the library was dressed in a business suit and wore her hair in a bun. There was no mistake he had found his mystery girl.
Sarah spotted Evan just as he headed toward her, and she slumped in her seat and pulled her book over her face, unsuccessfully trying to hide.
Evan approached Sarah. He smiled and waited patiently as her eyes peeked up at him from behind the book she was pretending to read. She lowered the book and sat up in her chair.
Evan held out the glasses that he had fixed and asked, “May I?” Sarah’s heart beat fast as she nodded.
 Her breathing increased, and her eyes closed as his hands moved toward her face. He carefully removed her glasses and replaced them with the glasses he repaired.
Following is a draft of the dialogue. The goal is to show Evan being cute and charming and Sarah finding him too charming to resist. And against her better judgment breaking from her study to go to the food court with him and get to know each other better.
Evan: “Ah, much better. Not that there’s anything wrong with the glasses you were wearing, but I like these a lot better. I hope I did a good job fixing them?”
Sarah: “Yes, you did. Thank you. How much do I owe you?”
Evan: “You don’t owe me anything! But you can join me for a snack at the food court. We could call it an energy exchange?”
Sarah was struggling to resist her desire to go with Evan.“I have studying to do.”
Evan: “You can’t take a half-hour break?”
Sarah: “No, I have a lot to study.”
Evan: “Well, I have to study too!”
Evan disappeared between two bookshelves. He returned to the table, sat across from Sarah, and intentionally read his book upside down.
Sarah: “Do you always read your books upside down?”
Evan turned the book right side up. “Ah, now this book makes more sense!”
Sarah laughed after reading the title, Female Poets of the 19th Century. “Really? You don’t look like a poetry major to me.”
Evan: “I love the female poets of the 19th century.”
Sarah: “Can you even name one?”
Evan: “Emily Dickinson!”
Sarah: “Do you know that, or is she the only female poet you’ve heard of?”
“I am an expert on female poetry from the 19th century!” joked Evan.
Sarah laughed. “You are, are you? Okay then, what is your favorite poem?” 
Evan looked down at the book. Sarah interrupted him.
“Close the book. Okay, now tell me your favorite poem.” 
He spun his whimsical tale. 
Evan: “Well, I can’t remember who wrote it, but I remember the name. It’s called The Kiss. It’s a poem about this beautiful coed saved from certain death by a valiant young man. They have this most amazing kiss. But then she disappears like Cinderella. He ultimately finds her, and she futilely attempts to resist his charming ways.”
Sarah smiled. “Hmm, interesting. So how does the poem end?” 
Evan: “Happily ever after, of course!”
Evan’s charm weakened her resolve as she attempted to refocus on her study material. Evan opened the book again and altered his facial expression and voice to mimic a distinguished professor.
He pretended to critique a poem.“Very nice. Excellent poetic structure. Great use of hyperbole.”
Sarah giggled. “You are going to keep annoying me until I agree to go to the food court, aren’t you?”
Evan: “Annoying? I was shooting for charming!”
Sarah laughed. “Okay, fine, annoyingly charming.”
Evan’s tone turned a bit more serious. “I’ll stop bothering you if you want. But I say let’s get to know each other. Unless I imagined it, that kiss was wonderful for you, too. All I’m asking for is 15 minutes. That’s it, just 15 minutes of your time! What do you say?”
Sarah relented and silently packed up her stuff.
“Is that a yes?” he asked.
 Sarah: “Yes, it is!” 
Sarah gathered up her stuff. Evan asked very gentlemanly as he motioned her to walk in front of him, and when they got to the door, he opened it for her. The scene will end at this point. The reader should be left feeling good about what happened and great anticipation for what comes next. Chemistry and romance are in the air.</Text>

            <Title>James Patterson</Title>
            <Text>In the bustling arena of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, two seniors whose paths never crossed, found themselves entangled in a saga that was far from ordinary. 
Evan Vaughn was not just another handsome face on campus. He was the alluring, athletic gentleman whose popularity was magnified by his humility and kindness. A man molded by his saintly sister Liz, Evan didn't let his charm overshadow his true self. Yet, his intellectual potential was hidden beneath his love for the outdoors and a promise he made to Liz, to graduate with a respectable 3.0 GPA.
Sarah Wilkins, unlike Evan, was the embodiment of academic brilliance. Destined to sit atop her class, she found solace in the sterile confines of the university library, consumed by her dedication to excel. As a business major, her promise to her father and herself was simple yet stringent: No romantic distractions until she ascended to the helm of her father's multimillion-dollar corporation.
The monotony of their separate lives was disrupted when Evan, playing the reluctant hero, saved Sarah from a near-disastrous fall on campus. In a twist fit for a Patterson novel, their heated encounter ended in a passionate kiss, leaving Sarah to battle the inner turmoil of emotions she was unprepared for.
In the aftermath, Evan finds Sarah again, returns her misplaced glasses, and relentlessly attempts to break the shell of her self-imposed solitude. Succumbing to Evan's charm, Sarah eventually agrees to date him, but not without laying down a series of strict rules, a reflection of her business-like approach to life.
Their relationship, though thriving on passion, was not devoid of complications. The unforeseen turn of events at their graduation party was a testament to this. Evan's surprise proposal in front of an unsuspecting audience, including Sarah's parents, rocked the very foundation of Sarah's meticulously planned future.
As Sarah grappled with the aftermath of the proposal, her father, a stoic yet fair man, presented her with an ultimatum: Follow her original plan and join him in Seattle after obtaining her Master's, or carve a new path with Evan in Chicago at the expense of her father's financial support.
In classic James Patterson style, this tale crescendos with Sarah's monumental decision. Facing the crossroads between her longstanding plan and the life she never imagined, she defies the odds, choosing Evan and her heart, thus beginning a thrilling journey into an unknown future.</Text>
            <Notes>[This scene is written in the style of James Patterson, using his distinctive fast-paced narrative and stark, high-contrast emotional landscape.]

            <Text>In the early semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, have yet to cross paths. Evan is a charismatic, athletic young man, admired and liked by all, yet keeps his ego in check, thanks to his sister, Liz. He's not an exceptional student, but he promised Liz he'd graduate with a GPA of at least 3.0, so he hits the books despite his preference for the outdoors.
Sarah, however, thrives in academia. She is certain to graduate top of her class and considers the university library her sanctuary. Also, as a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class weekly. One day, engrossed in an audio seminar, she loses track of time. As she rushes from the library, earbuds still in place, she fails to notice the steps in her path.
Evan, spotting Sarah's impending fall, rushes to her rescue. Their collision results in a passionate kiss. Sarah, having promised herself and her father she would avoid romantic entanglements until she starts her professional career, panics and rushes away, leaving behind her glasses without telling Evan her name.
A week later, Evan finds Sarah and returns her repaired glasses. He manages to charm her into a break at the food court. Sarah is stressed by Evan's popularity, especially with the female coeds, and begins to question herself. But Evan convinces her, and they share another passionate kiss before agreeing to a date.
Sarah, out of touch with typical dating protocols, enlists help from Katie Andrews, a student in her Business-101 class, for a makeover and wardrobe update. As she is at the salon, she questions her decision to remain romantically detached during college and decides to approach a relationship with Evan in a businesslike manner. Over dinner, she proposes rules and guidelines for their relationship, prioritizing her academics. Evan agrees, smitten since their first encounter.
Following their successful first date, Sarah becomes more open to romance and affection, while Evan improves academically with her help. Despite the prospect of Sarah pursuing her master's degree in an Ivy League school, they enjoy their time together, not discussing what lies beyond their graduation.
Unknown to Sarah, Evan plans to propose at the graduation party he's organizing with his friend Guido. He surprises her with an invite to her parents and a plaque honoring her academic achievements. Sarah, not having disclosed the depth of her feelings for Evan, panics as she accepts the proposal. She fears disappointing her father and veering from her life plan.
Meeting with her parents after the party, Sarah is given an ultimatum by her father. She can follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him, while still expected to get her master's degree and return to Seattle, or continue with her original plan. If she chooses Evan, she'll lose her father's financial support. Torn between her original plan and her feelings for Evan, she ultimately follows her heart, deciding to build a life with Evan in Chicago.</Text>

            <Text>The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is the stage for this deliciously fun, romantically tumultuous story that features our two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn. These two have never crossed paths before, and they seem to be complete opposites. 
Evan, a naturally charismatic and outgoing, is the kind of guy everyone on campus gravitates toward. Not just because of his stunning looks or athletic prowess, but because he genuinely treats everyone with kindness and respect. You would think that he is a bookworm just like Sarah, given his desire to maintain a 3.0 GPA, a promise to his amazing sister Liz. But actually, he would rather spend his time exploring the outdoors rather than being cooped up indoors studying.
Sarah, however, is the university's top-notch student, destined to graduate with flying colors. She's not just book-smart; she's also teaching a Business-101 class to freshmen. But that's not all there is to Sarah. Underneath her academic exterior, there's a side of her that hasn't yet had a chance to shine - the side that craves romance and human connection.
Their paths cross in an intense, cinematic moment where Evan saves Sarah from a nasty fall. Sparks fly and a heated, unexpected kiss follows. And just like that, Sarah's world is turned upside down. 
Sarah's been focused on her academics and career goals. She promised herself to avoid romance until after graduation, a pact she also made with her father. Yet, she can't help but be drawn to Evan. And when he finds her again to return her lost glasses, she can't resist his charm anymore. They agree to date, but not before Sarah outlines clear rules to ensure her academic goals aren't compromised. Evan agrees, not because he doesn't care, but because he's hopelessly in love.
Their senior year unfolds into a beautifully chaotic ride. Evan becomes a better student, and Sarah learns to enjoy life beyond her books. But as graduation looms, so do life's big decisions.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan is planning a grand proposal at their graduation party. To make matters more complicated, Evan secretly invites Sarah's parents. Sarah, utterly surprised, says yes, despite knowing she would have to readjust her life plans. Her parents, not fully aware of the depth of their relationship, leave in shock.
Sarah's father later presents her with a choice: stick to their agreed-upon plan of joining him in Seattle after pursuing her Master's or follow her heart with Evan in Chicago. The catch is, if she chooses Evan, she will lose her father's financial support. 
In classic Abbie Jimenez fashion, this tale delivers a high-stakes, emotionally charged decision. Sarah's logical side screams to stick to the plan, but her heart whispers to follow her love for Evan. And just like that, she chooses love. She chooses Evan. And with that, Sarah embarks on her path towards a life filled with love and adventure, a testament to the power of choosing happiness over the expected.</Text>

            <Title>Sarah's Classroom</Title>
            <Text>Name of the place: Business-101 Classroom 
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign/Urbana
Type of place: Large classroom
What role does this setting play in the story?
As a teacher's assistant, Sarah teaches first-year students enrolled in Business-101 in this large classroom once a week. 
This was the very classroom Sarah rushed into right after sharing her first kiss with Evan. Unusually late, she disrupted her otherwise flawless track record as a teaching assistant. Overwhelmed by the unexpected romantic encounter with Evan, she became uncharacteristically disorganized, jotting down lessons on the board that hadn't even been introduced yet.
In that moment, a more vulnerable and relatable version of Sarah emerged. While her students typically found her classes somewhat monotonous, they were pleasantly surprised by this unexpected shift in her demeanor. Thrown off balance by her interaction with Evan, Sarah managed to instruct in a manner that captivated her students, allowing them to see her in a new light. They realized that Sarah, contrary to their assumptions, was not one-dimensional but had a unique and engaging personality.
A week later, the same room served as the setting for another significant moment. Sarah approached one of her students, Katie, requesting assistance in preparing for her first date since she was a teenager. Eager to help, Katie readily agreed to give Sarah a modern makeover for her impending date with Evan.
Description: 
The University of Illinois boasted a sizable classroom where wisdom echoed off the walls and into the minds of its students. Laid out like a grand theater, the room contained over a dozen rows of tiered seating, reminiscent of the captivating cinematic venues. These rows were broken up into three sections, the flanking ones each housing six seats, while the central section accommodated a more significant twelve.
In an unconventional setting, the room featured no student desks; instead, each seat was designed such that the students could comfortably use their laps as makeshift writing surfaces. Each maroon seat, dark and durable, was affixed to its neighbor, contributing to the seamless, theater-like aesthetic.
Stairs conveniently partitioned the seating sections, providing easy access to each row, all the way up to the back of this spacious room. Looking up, the eyes were met with towering 30-foot ceilings, amplifying the grandeur of the classroom.
The teacher's area was flanked by an expansive whiteboard, dominating the wall space behind it. A wooden podium held court beside a similarly constructed desk, complete with an office chair nestled behind it, providing an organized yet inviting space for the instructor.
Two speakers, adhered to either side of the whiteboard, hung from the wall, ready to amplify the voice of knowledge resonating from the front of the room. The aesthetics of the room were warm yet disciplined, with chestnut-colored wood cladding the walls up to four feet from the ground. Above this wooden adornment, vanilla-painted walls ascended toward the lofty ceiling, providing a soothing contrast to the dark wood below.
Scattered symmetrically on both walls to the left and right of the seating were several identical pieces of neutral geometric artwork, adding a touch of creative elegance to the otherwise academic surroundings. These unobtrusive designs complemented the room's austere charm, contributing to the vibrant yet studious ambiance that permeated this well-loved classroom at the University of Illinois.</Text>
            <Notes>This is the classroom that Sarah went to immediately after Evan's and her’s first kiss. She was late for the first time in her teaching assistant career. When she arrived, she was uncharacteristically frazzled from her first kiss with Evan and started writing on the board material that had not been covered.
We see a more vulnerable and relatable version of Sarah at that moment. Typically her students find her class boring. But unsettled by her experience with Evan, she actually taught in a way the students enjoyed and could relate to. Her student got to see that indeed she does have a personality and is not as one-dimensional as they thought.
A week later, this location provides the venue for the scene where Sarah asks one of her students, Katie, to help her prepare for her first date since she was 16. Katie gladly offers to help Sarah with a modern makeover for her date with Evan.</Notes>

Evan protagonist in the story.
Beliefs: 
Evan, believes in the guiding influence of the &quot;Universe&quot; on people's life experiences. While he understands the Universe does not reveal its ultimate plan, he thinks it provides opportunities and signs to help humans navigate their journey.
Why does Evan withdraw and sometimes shut down when his suffering emotional duress?
Although Evan would benefit from talking to others who care about him when he suffers emotionally, he pulls away from others when in emotional pain. The reasons Evan gives for withdrawing when he is suffering are:
He doesn't like to draw attention to himself.
He surmises that the past is the past and cannot be changed. He sees no value in discussing painful memories and experiences that cannot be changed?
Most importantly to Evan, he doesn't want to bring negative energy to others. He would rather pull away and process the pain himself, in solitude. Then when he feels recovered, he crawls out of his hole and brings positive energy to the people around him.
What were Evan's romantic relationships like in college prior to meeting Sarah?
Although Evan doesn't perceive himself as a hopeless romantic, that is who he is. In order to love a woman romantically, he must feel that special chemistry with the woman that cannot be manufactured or faked.
However, Evan doesn't like to be alone, so he still has relationships while he waits for that special connection. Before meeting Sarah, he had never experienced that special chemical connection with anyone else.
Others would describe Evan as having a handful of girlfriends during college before meeting Sarah. However, he never considered the women that he went out with as girlfriends.
If he took a particular liking to a college coed but was not in love with her, he would start paying more attention to her. This special attention often misled these women into thinking he was their boyfriend. Because of Evan's vow to never even date two women at a time, when he would enter into an intimate relationship with the woman he liked but didn't love, he considered that relationship as friends with benefits. However, to the woman, she thought Evan was now her boyfriend.
After a few months in one of these relationships, Evan starts to pull out of the relationship and inadvertently breaks the woman's heart. However, it was college, and relationships were more casual then. So, it was never an overly dramatic situation.
Women just assumed that Evan had a fear of commitment. That wasn't true at all. Evan craved being in a committed relationship, but only if he was madly in love with his partner.
When he met Sarah, all the pieces fell into place for Evan. He fell immediately in love and was more than ready to commit to a relationship and call her his girlfriend. 
So, while others would've considered Sarah his sixth or seven girlfriend during college, Evan considered Sarah his first girlfriend and, ultimately, his first love.
It's important to note, that while Evan attracted the most beautiful women on campus, beauty was not his top priority when it came to his attraction to women. For Evan, attraction was about personality and chemistry.
Is Evan an introvert or an extrovert?
To label Evan as either an introvert or an extrovert would be a mistake. When suffering emotional duress, his propensity to withdraw might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state of being.
On the other hand, because of his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and befriending others, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred to avoid drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by conscious choice, but his good looks and warm personality made him popular. Whether someone were the star quarterback or the worst student in college, Evan would treat everyone kindly.
While Evan did not embrace his popularity, he humbly accepted the situation, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.</Text>

            <Title>Becky Wade</Title>
            <Text>In the early days of their senior year at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn existed as two separate universes. Unknown to each other, their paths had never crossed until fate decided to play its role.
Evan Vaughn, an embodiment of charm and athletic prowess, found himself loved by many. Despite his popularity, under his sister Liz's nurturing influence, he was a humble soul. From the football team captain to the bespectacled water boy, all received the same treatment of kindness and respect from Evan. 
Even though he had an innate knack for studies, Evan's heart danced outdoors, chasing winds and playing under the azure skies. However, he had given his word to Liz, promising a minimum 3.0 GPA on his graduation. And for Evan, promises were not to be broken, even if it meant sacrificing his favorite pastime for his books. As his GPA teetered close to his self-imposed threshold, Evan found himself headed to the unfamiliar territory of the undergrad library. 
Sarah, in contrast, was a prodigy, bound to be the valedictorian of her class. The library was her sanctuary, her comfort zone where she immersed herself in an audio seminar that held the secret to international business success. Oblivious to time, engrossed in her studies, she was on the brink of a first - being late to teach her Business-101 class. 
Sprinting up the library stairs, her earbuds secured in place, she burst out the door onto a raised campus platform. In her path lay a flight of concrete steps. Seeing her impending tumble, Evan dashed to intercept her. His call fell on her deaf ears, drowned out by the ongoing audio seminar. 
He reached her just in time, their bodies merging in a dance-like twirl, ending in a passionate kiss that set their world ablaze. Sarah, bred in an environment where academics took precedence over romance, was caught off guard. Her inexperienced heart fluttered in confusion. 
Even amidst the whirlwind of emotions, Sarah managed to escape without sharing her identity. Days later, Evan found her and returned her lost glasses. In an attempt to charm his way into her life, Evan invited her for a break at the food court. Despite her initial resistance, Sarah was captivated by Evan's allure. 
But doubts clouded her mind when she observed Evan's popularity, particularly among the coeds. Fleeing to her car, she was intercepted by Evan, their encounter leading to a date and a fiery kiss. 
To prepare for her date, Sarah sought assistance from Katie Andrews, a top student in her class. Together with Katie's hairstylist friend, they updated Sarah's style, giving her a modern look. 
Armed with her new look, Sarah approached her date with Evan like a business deal, setting rules and boundaries for their relationship. She prioritized her academic goals above all. Evan agreed, entranced by the captivating woman in front of him. 
As weeks passed, Sarah's hard exterior melted, exposing her softer, vulnerable side. Their date concluded with another fervent kiss and a memento from Evan that symbolized their unique love story. 
They thrived together, their relationship blossoming as Sarah grew more sociable and Evan improved his academic standing. Sarah's guidance even helped Evan secure a lucrative job in Chicago. However, future plans hung as an unspoken word between them, a mystery wrapped in silent exchanges and stolen kisses.
Unknown to Sarah, Evan planned to propose at their graduation party. Unaware of Evan's intentions, Sarah's parents accepted his invitation, thinking it was to celebrate Sarah's academic achievement. Sarah had downplayed her relationship with Evan to her parents, fearing their disappointment. 
Evan's proposal sent shock waves through Sarah. Torn between her heart's desires and her rationality, she accepted Evan's proposal. As the news sunk in, her parents retreated to their rented penthouse suite, leaving the couple amidst their friends. 
With the party over and her facade of happiness set aside, Sarah dreaded her meeting with her father. She respected him deeply and had always shared his vision until this moment. Sarah was left to face her father's disappointment and the consequences of her actions. 
Her father gave her an ultimatum - either follow Evan to Chicago and build a life there or stick to her initial plan. She had a month to decide, a month to choose between the man she loved and her dreams. 
Sarah was torn between her feelings for Evan and her promise to her father. Evan had an unshakeable bond with his sister, Liz, who lived in Chicago, and he was set to start his job soon. Sarah knew she couldn't ask Evan to uproot his life and wait for her. 
Her head said to follow her initial plan, but her heart was screaming for her to follow Evan. Against all odds, she chose her heart, stepping into an unknown yet exciting future with Evan.</Text>

            <Title>Rick Riordan</Title>
            <Text>In the early days of their final year at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, found their paths crossing. Neither Sarah nor Evan had ever encountered each other in their previous years, despite sharing the same university campus. 
Evan was the kind of guy who effortlessly commanded attention, his charm and charisma captivating everyone around him. He was popular, yet his popularity never inflated his ego, thanks to his sister Liz's guidance. He was equally kind to everyone, whether they were the university's star quarterback or the most reclusive bookworm. His academic standing, however, was a different story. 
Evan could've been a stellar student, but he preferred the crisp outside air to a lecture room's stale atmosphere. But he had promised Liz, he'd graduate with at least a 3.0 GPA. His current GPA hovered precariously around the agreed threshold, and to keep his promise, he found himself heading to the library more often than he'd like.
Sarah, on the other hand, was an academic paragon. Graduation saw her at the top of her class, and she considered the library her sanctuary. In her usual spot, she was deeply absorbed in an audio seminar about international business techniques. So absorbed that she lost track of time and risked being late to the Business-101 class she taught once a week. With earbuds still in, Sarah hurriedly ascended the library stairs and burst out onto the university platform.
Evan, recognizing her distracted rush towards the perilous, handrail-less concrete stairs, tried to warn her, but his shouts were drowned out by the seminar still blaring in her ears. He sprinted towards her, aiming to intercept her before the stairs. 
He got there just in time, their bodies colliding in a tango-esque whirl. Their eyes met, and a kiss, fiery and passionate, followed. 
Raised with a single-minded focus on academics and groomed to take over her father's corporate empire after graduation, Sarah had always sidelined romance. Her social life was limited to the elite circles she mingled with during her volunteer work for various nonprofit organizations. Despite her stunning looks, she had minimal experience with love and romance. 
Still in shock and worry about her impending tardiness, Sarah fled, leaving Evan dazed, her name and number unknown to him.
Several days later, Evan found her. He returned the glasses she'd left in her rush, which he'd taken upon himself to repair. Evan, with his disarming charm, eventually persuaded Sarah to take a break. 
At the food court, Sarah began questioning the stark differences between them. She saw how much the other coeds adored him, how outgoing he was, so different from her introverted personality. Fearful, she excused herself and bolted for her car, only to be caught by Evan. Eventually, they agreed to a date, sealed with another passionate kiss.
With no idea what to wear for a date, having not been on one since she was 16, Sarah turned to Katie Andrews, one of her top students in her Business-101 class. With Katie and her stylist friend's help, they modernized her style, swapping glasses for contacts and adding lowlights to her golden locks.
In the salon, she contemplated the implications of breaking her vow of avoiding romance while still in college. If she was going to engage in a relationship, she was going to approach it logically, like a business negotiation.
Their first dinner was akin to a business meeting, with Sarah outlining guidelines for their relationship, emphasizing her goal to graduate at the top. Evan, smitten since their first kiss, agreed, happy to have a relationship built on clarity. One week after their chance encounter, they became an official couple.
As the relationship progressed, Sarah allowed herself to explore the uncharted territories of romance, revealing a side of her that craved affection, a side she didn't know existed until Evan.
They spent the rest of their senior year together, growing and evolving. Sarah discovered her social side while Evan improved his academics, even securing a lucrative job in Chicago thanks to Sarah.
Evan planned to propose at the graduation party, with Sarah's parents secretly invited. They believed the occasion was to celebrate Sarah's academic success. Sarah had kept her relationship with Evan casual to her parents, hiding the depth of her feelings. She feared her father's disappointment, having promised to stick to her academic goals.
Evan's proposal took Sarah by surprise. Though every rational part of her screamed rejection, she said yes. She loved Evan too much to reject him, even if it meant diverting from her planned path and following Evan to Chicago.
After Sarah accepted Evan's proposal, her parents slipped out of the party, leaving Sarah with the impending confrontation. The idea of disappointing her father, someone she respected immensely, was devastating.
After the party, she met her parents. Her father, always fair, gave her two choices: stick to her original plan and attend an Ivy League school or follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him. She had a month to decide.
Evan's bond with his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, was unshakable. She knew she couldn't ask him to abandon his new job and wait for her. She faced a clear choice: stick to her plan or build a life with Evan in Chicago.
Her brain said to follow the plan; her heart said to choose Evan. Against all odds, she followed her heart.</Text>

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                   Part One

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font
used by their house. This PDF file was generated using
Scrivener's compile feature and was created using the &quot;Novel&quot;
project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-
caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

                                                 Chapter Two

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character
during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                   Part Two

                                               Chapter Three

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert the word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt;
Insert &gt; Draft Word Count. (For a manuscript, you may wish to
have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case
select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest
100--this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript,
in fact.)


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In
reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Title>Danielle Steele</Title>
            <Text>In the picturesque landscape of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, two worlds are destined to collide. Sarah Wilkins, an intellectual luminary, and Evan Vaughn, an endearing athlete, both seniors, are entering their first semester. Their paths have never crossed until one fateful encounter at the undergrad library changes everything. 
Evan, possessing a magnetic charisma, is the golden boy of the campus, charming all who cross his path. But his appeal isn't a matter of choice; rather, it's the natural outcome of his outgoing personality, fostered by his wise and nurturing sister, Liz. Despite his popularity, Evan is not without flaws. His academic performance leaves room for improvement, and he has made a promise to Liz to graduate with at least a 3.0 GPA. As his senior year commences, he trades his beloved Frisbee games for hours of focused study, keeping Liz's promise foremost in his mind.
Sarah, on the other hand, is the epitome of academic brilliance. An ambitious business major, she finds solace in the silence of the library, her ears filled with audio seminars on international business strategies. Time slips away unnoticed in these moments, and one day, she finds herself on the brink of being late to a class she teaches. In a rush, she charges toward the library exit, oblivious to the imminent danger of a flight of stairs devoid of a handrail.
Evan, noticing the potential accident, tries to warn Sarah, but his shouts fall on her earbud-filled ears. With no time to spare, he rushes forward, just in time to catch her before she stumbles. This dramatic save culminates in an impulsive, intense kiss, awakening unexplored feelings in both of them.
Sarah, however, has been reared with a staunch academic focus and ambition to succeed her father at the helm of his multi-million-dollar corporation. The sudden blush of romance with Evan unsettles her. She has, until now, shunned any romantic entanglements, focusing on her academic aspirations.
Despite the confusion, Sarah is irresistibly drawn to Evan. He manages to track her down, returning the glasses she had left behind and charming her into a break at the food court. They embark on a whirlwind romance, with Sarah setting rules and expectations to safeguard her academic priorities. Evan, already enamored by Sarah, gladly agrees to her terms.
The ensuing year is a transformative one. Sarah learns to navigate social circles, and Evan, under Sarah's influence, improves academically. Yet, with graduation looming, Sarah is torn between her commitment to her father and the pull of her heart toward Evan.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan is planning a marriage proposal. On the day of their graduation party, amidst friends and a surprise visit from her parents, Evan pops the question. Sarah, who has underplayed the intensity of their relationship to her parents, is taken aback. 
Her father, a man of stoic but fair character, presents her with a choice - to follow her heart to Chicago with Evan, risking financial support, or to adhere to her initial plan of pursuing her Master's degree and joining her father's corporation. Torn between her mind and her heart, Sarah is faced with a daunting decision.
In the style of Danielle Steel, this story unfolds with high emotion and heart-stirring choices. Against all odds, Sarah's heart emerges victorious, choosing a life with Evan in Chicago over her original plan.</Text>
            <Notes>Style: Danielle Steele. Danielle Steele's novels often involve internal conflict, complicated relationships, and a detailed focus on the protagonist's thoughts and emotions. The dialogue is simple, and there's an undercurrent of romance and hope. Her writing style is also noted for its detailed descriptions, emotionality, and dramatic storytelling. 

[This scene is written in the style of Danielle Steele, with her signature blend of romantic turmoil and emotional upheaval, played out against the backdrop of everyday life.] </Notes>

            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0122 Evan is a Man With a Plan
Characters: Evan
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Locations: In the car, driving to campus.
Tone: Optimistic, hopeful
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions:
Do not refer to Evan as &quot;penny-pinching.&quot; Stay away from synonyms of that as well. For example, don't use the word frugal when describing Evan. 
Sequence of Events:
The scene starts with Evan driving to campus in his old but reliable vehicle – a Subaru small SUV with over a hundred thousand miles, about what you'd expect for a financially struggling college student.
The weather was perfect like it was the day he and Sarah met.
He was playing an energetic song on the radio. The Cubs won their game the night before. Life was Good.
Guido successfully talked Evan out of hours of Internet searching, seeking his mystery girl. 
Guido also convinced Evan what a sorry sight he was sitting in the rain waiting for a woman that would never show. And even if she did, she might find the site of a desperate man unappealing.
After a solid night’s sleep, Evan woke up with an inspired idea. He was sure it would meet with success. It was like the Universe planted this thought seed in his mind overnight. He couldn't believe he didn't think of it before.
Upon waking up, he remembered how Sarah was dressed like a professor.  He thought, &quot;She is probably a bookworm. Where do I find a bookworm? The library. Duh!&quot;
This revelation injected an air of confidence and Evan.
When he got to campus, he was going to the spot of their first kiss. If she weren’t there, he wouldn’t wait futilely outside. Instead, he would head down into the undergrad library – where he was certain he would find her.
This scene is primarily a setup scene for the next scene he appears in and finds Sarah in the library as expected. The scene should end with Evan closing his car door, taking a deep breath of the early fall air, and confidently heading to the library. He is excited but not anxious. I want the reader to feel confident along with Evan.</Text>

            <Title>0130 Evan and Sarah Food Court Date</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan convinces Sarah to break from her studies and join him at the food court for a snack. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0130 Evan and Sarah Food Court Date
Characters: Evan, Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Locations: Outside the entrance doors to the undergrad library. The area at and around the spot where Evan and Sarah first kissed.
Tone: Sweet, funny, intriguing, exciting, frantic. The scene has a bit of all emotion.
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
This scene is essential because it shows Evan is more than muscles, lips, and charm. When Sarah makes yet another attempt to escape, and this time Evan stops her, they finally have a chance to talk.
Sarah is used to being the smartest person in the room, even amongst adults older than her. That being said, this shows that Evan can hold his own in a conversation with her. 
At first, Sarah's disoriented by Evan's ability to communicate with her so intelligently. Sarah found herself more attracted to Evan with every word he said. 
This may be very subtle in this scene, but Sarah begins to see that she could have a relationship with someone like Evan. Evan is someone not afraid to challenge her. She was impressed by how Evan was not intimidated by her IQ or GPA. 
But more than that, she felt herself changing in real time as she spoke to him. He brought a softer side out in her. He got her to think outside of her rigid box – thinking in ways she had never thought before.
If possible, or once they start talking outside the food court, see if you can build the attraction momentum as she becomes more and more attracted to him. Although she still resists. The attraction building is as much intellectual as it is physical. Sarah could have resisted Evan if the attraction was merely physical. The way to Sarah's heart is through her mind.
I've included a rough first draft. Here are a few items I need help with:
Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. I'm particularly interested in maintaining the authentic voice of my characters and the specific flow of the conversation.
What I like about this scene is how it escalates the scene before. In the prior scene, Evan gets Sarah to agree to a 15-minute break. Now he gets her to agree to a date. As the scenes move forward, he successfully whittles away her resistance.
I like how this scene has multiple emotions. Try keeping those in the scene as much as possible.
Since this is the one and only seen at the food court, I'd like to include a vivid description so that the reader can feel that they are there in the food court with Evan and Sarah. I have a draft narrative you can work off of.

Food Court Description:
The food court at the University of Illinois is a bustling hub of activity, brimming with the sounds of students engaging in lively conversation, the clatter of trays and dishes, and the aromas of a myriad of different cuisines. The spacious place has high ceilings and a skylight allowing natural light during the day. In the evening, the area is illuminated by an assortment of warm, overhead lights.
Multiple food stalls line the perimeter, offering an international array of food options. From quick bites like burgers and pizzas to various Asian cuisines, Italian pasta dishes, and Mexican delights, the diversity is impressive. There's also a salad bar for those preferring healthier options and an irresistible dessert station filled with sweet treats.
In the center of the food court is a large seating area filled with a mix of chairs, booths, and high tables. The seating arrangements are flexible, accommodating large groups and those who wish to dine alone.
The walls are adorned with vibrant murals depicting various aspects of university life and local landmarks, giving the space a unique, youthful, and energetic vibe.
The atmosphere in the food court is always lively and vibrant, filled with the infectious energy of students refueling between classes, discussing their latest projects, or simply hanging out and enjoying their meals.
Sequence of Events:
Evan made sure that after they exited the library, they walked past the exact spot of their first kiss. He stopped, looked at Sarah, and said,  “I’ve been waiting to kiss you again since the first moment I saw you today.”
Sarah felt reluctant, overwhelmed, and uncertain of all that was happening. But she couldn’t deny to herself how incredible it felt when kissing Evan. He grabbed her hand. “Let’s go!”
“What are you doing?” asked Sarah.
“I’m holding your hand.” Evan sensed Sarah needed more of an answer. “I figured it was okay. Everything less than that is allowed once you’ve gone to a certain point with someone. Since we already kissed twice, holding hands seems a given.”
She struggled to find any flaw in Evan’s logic, so they continued to the food court, holding hands. Sarah felt eyes watching and noticed a pattern. First, a student looked at Evan and said “hi,” then they looked at her as if she were an alien and then looked at their joined hands as if she had committed a crime. Sarah noticed that Evan appeared to be acquainted with every student on campus. Although she realized it was her imagination, 90% of them seemed female.
They arrived at the food court. Sarah sat down at a table as Evan asked what she would like from the food court. She said, “Anything’s fine, just something light.” 
A few minutes later, Evan returned with bottles of water and fruit cups. Sarah thanked Evan.
“I think it’s best if we start by exchanging names. My name is Evan.”
“I’m Sarah.”
“Hi, Sarah! Can you tell me something about yourself?”
She was never comfortable socializing with people her own age. Uncertain of how to respond to Evan’s question, she recited her extensive and impressive resume. She spoke at high speed, listing accomplishments one by one.
Although this wasn’t the information he was after, he found her response cute and tried to stay focused on her words. As students walked by, many greeted Evan or nodded a “hello” to him. Evan did his best to nod back while listening to Sarah.
Sarah was feeling more awkward by the minute. She became quite anxious, causing her to get up and dash toward the exit.
Evan: “Where are you going?” 
Evan was intent not letting her get away again. He chased after her. 
Evan called her, “Hey, Cinderella, wait up, wait up!” before catching up with her.
She stopped and turned to him. “Why do you call me Cinderella?”
“Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”
“Why do you keep pursuing me? It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.” 
“I want to learn more about you. What’s wrong with that?”
“It doesn’t take a genius to see that we exist in different worlds.”
Evan laughed. “Let me guess. You’re a genius?”
“I do have a genius IQ, but that’s not my point.”
“What is your point?” he asked.
“As a couple, we make little sense. I came to college to get an education and network with professionals to further my academic and professional careers. I committed to focusing on my work and refraining from distracting relationships. You don’t need me. You must know every female on campus.”
Evan smiled. “Are you jealous? You have nothing to worry about.”
“I’m not jealous. I simply can’t understand why you’re focusing your attention on me.”
“Because I am attracted to you. There is something about you that feels right. Is that so hard to accept? I understand the importance of education, but college is more than classes and exams. It’s about relationships, having fun, trying new things.”
“I promised my Father that typical college hijinks would not distract me.”
“Did your Father ask you not to build meaningful relationships?”
“No, not exactly. He advised me to stay focused.”
“Do you think he doesn’t want you to enjoy your college experience?”
“Of course, I don’t think that. He does say how important it is to be a well-rounded individual. But Evan, I made a plan that makes sense and have held to it for three years.”
“Doesn’t it make sense to enjoy your college life? Doesn’t it make sense, as you say, to be well-rounded? If so, doesn’t it make sense to pursue new relationships?”
Sarah was exasperated. She wasn’t used to someone challenging her perspective so effectively. “You have got my head spinning. It doesn’t help that every time you kiss me, my IQ drops 50 points. How can my plan make so much sense, yet your completely opposite approach makes sense too?”
“How can a piece of paper be both thin and wide?”
That statement made her think long enough for Evan to kiss her again.
He said, “I don’t work Thursday. Let’s have dinner away from campus. Do you like Thai food? The Thai Garden is a great place. It’s too expensive for your average college crowd, but it won’t break the bank. Thursday night, dinner at seven? It’s just one date. Let’s get to know each other.”
“Alright, I will meet you there at 7:30.”
Evan smacked his hand together. “That’s awesome! Can I get your phone number? Your Last Name?”
Sarah still had mixed feelings. “Let’s wait and see how it goes.”
“Do you have any plans now?”
“I am going to drive home and try to get some work done,” said Sarah.
Evan held out his hand. “May I walk you to your car?” 
Her breath returned to normal as she became more comfortable holding hands in public. When they got to her car, Evan asked, “May I get a kiss goodbye?”
“Of Course!”
After not being kissed for five years, she couldn’t get enough of Evan’s kisses. After a long make-out session, Evan asked, “How’s that IQ doing?”
Sarah made a rare joke, “2+2 equals 10.”
They laughed together as if it was the funniest joke ever told.
Evan said, “I’m afraid to let you go. I’m worried you won’t show up on Thursday.” 
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. I never break an appointment unless it’s an emergency.”</Text>

            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0115 Sarah is Frazzled
Characters: Sarah, Katie
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Sarah's Classroom
Tone: Sarah was frantic at the beginning of class but had an epiphany. She decided to embrace the moment, relax, and conduct a more collaborative teaching session – a  stark contrast from her typical one-way lecture teaching style.
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
Start the scene with a vivid description of the location as defined in the location profile.
Include the confusion and mixed energy of the class as they look at a vacant podium and wonder where their always punctual teacher's assistant, Sarah, is.
The dialogue provided may be used or changed at your discretion.
Sequence of Events:
Sarah arrived 10 minutes late to her Business-101 class. However, that was not the biggest shock for her students. They had never seen their teacher without her glasses on or with her long hair let down.
Hoping to hide the internal chaos she was feeling, she straightened her outfit and her expression. 
Sarah: “I apologize for being late. It will not happen again. Today we will review topics on next week’s exam.”
She wrote on the board. One student raised his hand. “Ms. Wilkins, we have never discussed that material.”
Still lightheaded from her kiss with Evan, Sarah inadvertently wrote information relating to the next section of the course. She took a deep breath, walked to the front of her desk, leaned back in a semi-seated position, and chose a fresh approach to the review session. 
Sarah: “Did you ever have one of those days where something happens that you didn’t expect, and it throws you off your game?”
Most of the class smiled and acknowledged they could relate.
Sarah: “Today is one of those days for me.”
In stark contrast to her usually dry and monotone teaching style, Sarah spoke in a relaxed, relatable tone.
Sarah: “Let me tell you a secret about exams. 80% of the questions simply test your memorization. The other 20% are often trick questions to gauge how thoroughly you understand the material. Let's focus on the trick questions instead of wasting time on simple questions. I think this will give everybody a better chance to ace this exam. Is everyone agreeable to that?”
The vote was unanimous. The students were excited they might enjoy Sarah’s class for once. After the session ended, one student, Katie Andrews, stopped by the teacher’s desk.
Katie: “Ms. Wilkins, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed our class today. Whatever happened, I hope will happen again next week!” 
Sarah thought “Me Too!”</Text>

What role does this setting play in the story? 
This location plays a vital role because this is where Evan and Sarah have their first kiss—affectionately known as &quot;The Kiss&quot; by Evan's friends and family. Sarah was rushing to class and wasn't paying attention to her surroundings. She was seconds away and falling down the stairs, but then Evan swooped in to save her, and they kissed in the heat of the moment.
Description: 
Not far from the library’s exit are four concrete steps leading downward. It's important to note that the railings for these concrete steps are few and far between. The staircase itself is over 40 feet wide. If one is not paying attention, it would be easy to take a hard fall on the concrete steps, where a railing may be too far away to spirit someone the fall.</Text>

            <Title>Plot Summaries</Title>
            <Notes>For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his nurturing sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy. 
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments. 
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz. 
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds, listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally. 
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything. 
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls. 
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs. 
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss. 
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire. 
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career. 
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age. 
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number. 
A few days later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself. 
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break. 
At the food court, Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car. 
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment. 
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews. 
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart. 
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class. 
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations. Just one week after the first kiss, Evan and Sarah were romantic partners.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan. 
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss. 
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together. 
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel. 
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit. 
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him. 
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals. 
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago. 
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person. 
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle. 
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s unshakable bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan. 
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.

            <Title>0121 Sarah Can't Concentrate</Title>
            <Text>In the belly of the college campus, nestled far beneath the radiant sunshine, the Undergraduate Library thrived. A pulsing, energetic heart in the subterranean world. Sarah, a familiar occupant of this hub of knowledge, felt like a stranger on that day.
Sarah sat beneath the ever-vibrating fluorescence of the library lights, her once cascading blonde hair swept up hastily in a ponytail, a testament to her unsettled state of mind. The normal academic challenges that gave her pleasure were no longer enticing. She was distracted, unable to center her thoughts on anything other than the recent, life-altering kiss.
In an attempt to battle the whirlwind of emotions, she found herself engaging in uncharacteristic activities. Neatening her workspace was an attempt to control the uncontrollable, to bring order to her chaotic feelings. The meticulous cleaning of her eyeglasses and the organization of her purse felt like menial tasks compared to the war waging within her.
She was torn, an internal conflict raging between her promise to herself to steer clear of romantic entanglements and the budding yearning for that intoxicating connection she'd experienced. The emotion was unfamiliar, alarming, yet intoxicating.
With a mind ablaze with memories and questions, she drifted through the library, seemingly engrossed in selecting books she knew she would not read. Her fingertips traced their spines in aimless exploration, a physical manifestation of her emotional wandering.
Is this how women feel when they fall for someone? The question hung in her mind, casting long shadows over her thoughts. She found it hard to imagine getting anything done with such a potent distraction.
Days had passed since the kiss, days where her academic progress had been at a standstill, but Sarah had always been ahead. Her strong work ethic had given her a buffer, saving her from the brink of academic peril.
In the lively and dynamic ambiance of the library, Sarah stood at the precipice of emotional turmoil, caught between her past resolution and her present desires. She was a ship adrift in an ocean of emotion, no landmark in sight, her compass spinning uncontrollably.</Text>

POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: City
Tone: Frantic, Funny, Romantic
Special Instructions: 
Focus on Sarah's inner thoughts and feelings during item #16. 
Item #9 Is meant to have a humorous tone.
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
First-year lawyer Sarah was reviewing tedious real estate contracts in her office.
She looked at the time on her phone and realized she was in danger of being late for an important meeting.
She put her earbuds in and listened to an audio seminar on best practices in real estate law. She had posited earlier but wanted something to keep her mind occupied while she walked to the train station.
She exited her office building doors and walked on a sizeable flat brick-paved platform with four concrete stairs leading downward.
Her pace was fast because she was in a bit of a panic.
Her mind was preoccupied with concerns about tardiness and the voice coming through her earbuds.
Evan had never met Sarah.
He saw she was not paying attention and was only a few feet away from the concrete stairs with no railing.
He called out to warn her. He shouted, “Hey lady and the skirt suit!&quot; everyone heard him except the lady in the skirt suit.
He didn't know if he could make it, but he took off at high speed to try and stop her before she fell on the concrete stairs with no railing.
He caught her just in time, but the momentum of her fast pace caused her body to swing around as if they were in a dance and he was dipping her.
Her briefcase and purse went flying everywhere.
She found herself leaning back almost parallel to the ground.
Evan was bent over facing her, his hands supporting her back.
Their eyes connected, and they gazed longingly at each other.
Finally, Evan leaned down and kissed Sarah. It was a deep passionate kiss.
After the kiss, Evan lifted Sarah back to her feet.
She remembered how late she was and frantically gathered her belongings with Evan's assistance.
Evan asked her her name.
Out of sorts, she responded, &quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot;
Evan laughed and said, &quot;That's a strange name.&quot;
Sarah was too out of sorts to recognize she brought unintended humor to this romantically charged moment.
Being bewildered and frantic, Sarah dashed off toward the train station.</Text>

            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0120 Waiting Game
Characters: Evan, Guido
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Locations: Outside the entrance doors to the undergrad library. The area at and around the spot where Evan and Sarah first kissed.
Tone: The scene starts with Evan hopeful. But as the rain began to drizzle down on him, Evan watched hundreds of people come in and out of the library, none of them being Sarah. With no sight of her, he gradually got sadder and sadder.
Guido came to check on him and successfully got Evan to stop torturing himself at that location and head back to their apartment. 
Guido was also able to instill a bit of hope in Evan.
The scene does a full circle when it comes to Tone. The scene starts with hope,  turns to disappointment, sadness, and then despair before returning to a muted version of hope.
Weather: Cloudy, drizzly
Special Instructions: 
Since there is no dialogue in the first part of this scene, focus on Evan's thoughts and feelings as his emotions roller coaster at first before heading down a steep decline until Guido arrived. I really want the reader to suffer along with Evan. Integrating the increasingly gloomy weather and aligning it with his mood deterioration is essential to help the reader visualize Evans suffering.
Although Guido was not considered a nurturing or compassionate human being, I would like the reader to see he does have a caring side, even if his method of expressing that care is not typical of what others might do.
Even though Guido doesn't really understand why Evan is so distressed, he wanted to be there for his best friend in whatever way he could. 
The dialogue and narratives I have provided may be used as is or changed at your discretion.
Understanding the precise spot where Evan and Sarah had their first kiss is essential. The kiss happened outside in an open, uncovered area on four concrete stairs leading downward from a flat platform. Evan had saved her from a fall, leading to a passionate kiss. The actual spot where they kissed was at least 30 feet from the library entrance.
In the scene, I don't want the reader to think that Evan is stood right in front of the library doors watching people come and go. In his 2-hour, Evan shifts from place to place but never gets too close to the kissing spot or the library entry and exit doors. He is always at least 20 are 30 feet away. I don't want the reader to think Evan is overly pathetic or so desperate that he must stand just 2 feet from the kissing spot or the library entrance doors.
Sequence of Events:
Evan returned to the location where he and Sarah first kissed. He was feeling hopeful, but his hope was diminished a bit, still feeling the disappointment from her not returning to this spot the Friday before.
It was Monday. He figured he had a better chance of seeing her again if he skipped the weekend and returned on a school day. 
His excitement with yo-yo every time he caught a glimpse of blonde hair in his periphery. Every time the door to the undergrad library opened, his heart would skip a beat, thinking it would be her. But she was nowhere to be found.
As time rolled by, the rain rolled in. It started drizzling about half an hour into his wait and continually worsened for another 90 minutes.
Evan had a jacket on but didn't think to bring an umbrella. He did his best to find trees and awnings to stand under to help keep them dry. But he refused to pick any spot that didn't give him a direct view of the library doors and the place where he and Sarah first kissed—his effort to remain dry produced minimal results.
After Evan had been there a couple of hours, Guido came to check on him.
Guido: &quot;No Luck?”
Evan looked dejected. With his head down, he said, &quot;No, I haven't seen her.&quot;
Guido provided his version of consolation, &quot;Sorry, bro. Don't stress it. There are plenty of fish in the sea.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't want to fish in the sea. She's the only one for me.&quot;
Guido: &quot;I don't get you, bro. You got women lined up to be with you, and you're stressing over a girl whose name you don't know? You should adopt my style – no strings attached, no drama.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Yeah, and no hope for love.&quot;
In a way, Guido admired Evan. Guido chuckled. &quot;My friend, ever the hopeless romantic.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm just... I'm just...just…&quot; Evan couldn't find the words to express his sentiment. Frustrated, he said, &quot;I don't know what I am. I just know that I have to see my Cinderella again.&quot;
Guido felt for Evan. Guido joked. &quot;Let's leave the matching glass slipper search for another day. Come on, let's head back to our place. We’ll knock down a few beers and watch baseball. The Cubs actually have a chance for the playoffs this year!&quot;
Evan remained silent but didn't appear ready to go with Guido.
Guido gently persisted. &quot;You'll feel a lot better with a cold brew in your hand and a Cubs victory on the TV. I’ll tell you what, after the game, we’ll try to figure a way to get her name.&quot;
Evan, still silent, was not yet persuaded.
Guido joked, &quot;How hard can it be to find the most beautiful girl on campus?&quot;
Guido's words brought a small smile to Evan's face. 
 Evan: &quot;I suppose you're right. I'll bump into her sooner or later.&quot;
Guido: &quot;Exactly! Let's chill at home, and we’ll scour the Internet when the game ends.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Thanks, dude. I feel better already.&quot;
Nothing more was said as they headed home. The scene ends here. I want the reader to feel Evan's contrasting motions of disappointment that he didn't see Sarah and hope that inevitably he'll find his way to her.&quot;

Her primary dream is to expand her father's corporation internationally and eventually take over her father's role as CEO. Of secondary importance, she would like to be married and have a child to raise like she was raised. However, she would only want a child if it didn’t interfere with her professional aspirations.
Education background: 
She graduated as valedictorian from Ballard  High School – class of 2003.
She is in his senior year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Working on earning a Bachelor's Degree in Business. 
Family/general background: 
Sarah Wilkins, an only child, was a beacon of exceptionalism, born and bred for success. Raised in a household where playdates and frivolous activities were forsaken for the grandeur of academia, Sarah found herself immersed in an ocean of knowledge from an early age. Her childhood revolved around devouring non-fiction educational books, her imagination flickering not with tales of adventure but with the enlightening prose of fact and theory.
Her parents, particularly her domineering father, were the rudder that steered the ship of her life. The University of Illinois, her father's alma mater, became Sarah's undergraduate choice despite being capable of securing a scholarship to any institution across the country. Even with the allure of prestigious Ivy League schools for her postgraduate studies, the sense of legacy and deference to her father's wishes guided her decision.
Sarah's relationship with her father was less traditional and more of a mentorship, a catalyst that stimulated her thirst for learning. Their household, punctuated by an omnipresent stoicism, eschewed affection for mutual respect. Hugs were a rarity, with personal growth and intellectual achievement held on a higher pedestal.
Sarah was a paragon of her parents' molding, embracing the rigorous standards they set for her. Her extraordinarily high IQ melded seamlessly with their crafted path, creating an academic prodigy poised for greatness. Valedictorian of her high school, she graduated college with the same top honors, her formidable pre-college resume testament to her commitment and prowess.
In the whirlwind of academia, Sarah found herself baffled by the incessant chatter of girls concerning boys. While she wasn't entirely immune to the fluttering feelings of attraction, dating was more of an anthropological study for her. She wanted to decipher the energy and time girls dedicated to boys, a concept alien to her own mindset.
As she transitioned to college, Sarah made a pact with herself: no dalliances, no romantic distractions. Her goal was singular - acquire her master's degree, lay the foundation of a successful professional life. It was a pledge set in stone, the echo of her parents' teachings resonating within her, guiding her towards the brilliance they had prepared her for.
Relationship status/history: 
In high school, Sarah experimented briefly with boys. She wasn't a virgin when she started college but had minimal experience compared to other females her age.
Before meeting Evan, she honored her commitment to avoid all romantic entanglements in college.
Health history: 
Sarah was meticulous regarding self-care. Her dietary habits would impress the strictest of nutritionists. She was religious in her exercise routine, combining time indoors at the gym and jogging and biking outdoors.
Interestingly, Sarah's motivation to keep healthy and fit had little to do with vanity or lifespan. Instead, she always wants to look presentable and confident in business meetings, negotiations, and social events from philanthropic endeavors and business ventures.
How does the character handle stress or crisis situations?  
Sarah is as stoic as they come. She is calm under pressure. Her high IQ and business brilliance often lead to quickly resolving any crisis.
What motivates this character? 
Even before Sarah began her high school journey, her path forward was as clear as a sunlit highway. She would be the valedictorian of her graduating class – this wasn't a possibility; it was an expectation. Such was the certainty of her brilliance and the weight of the destiny she felt she had been handed down.
The University of Illinois was the stepping stone, a nod to her father's legacy. Once there, she intended to dominate the academic charts, rising as cream does to the top. Her sights, though, were firmly set on the gleaming towers of the Ivy League for her master's degree, an ambition as naturally conceived as a sunflower turning towards the sun.
College was not just about academics for Sarah. It was an opportunity to broaden her connections and foster relationships within circles of influence and wealth. Her philanthropic endeavors, while rooted in a sincere desire to make a difference, also served the dual purpose of positioning her within networks of power. Every charity event attended, every fundraiser led, they were stepping stones on the path to fulfilling her destiny.
Primary Goal: Sarah's ultimate goal was to replace her father as CEO of his multi-million dollar corporation.
Key Conflict: 
Sarah's key conflict was her decision to take the alternative path and build a life with Evan instead of sticking to her rigid plan of getting her master's degree and working her way up the corporate ladder at her father's corporation.
What is the character's role in the novel? 
Sarah's role is as the love interest to the protagonist of the book, Evan,You
Sarah was Evan's first love, first wife, and first source of a broken heart caused by the end of a romantic relationship.
The pain Evan suffered from this relationship was a catalyst for Evan devising a relationship strategy in which he could benefit from the togetherness of a romantic relationship but not suffer devastating levels of heartache when it inevitably comes to an end.
Later in the story, she meets Chloe, which at first is a dramatically negative experience for them both. However, this led to a bond when Chloe realized that Sarah was not the villainess she had been portrayed as. Chloe finally understood what Evan and Liz saw in Sarah that others didn't. For Chloe, Sarah was no longer this hidden part of Evan's past occupying a part of his heart that she could not access. Meeting Sarah in person was the catalyst for Chloe finally overcoming her jealousy and insecurity at feeling second best to Sarah.
Ultimately, Chloe arranges for Sarah and Evan to meet when he may not live much longer. At that moment, Sarah and Evan finally got the closure that had eluded them.
What are some of the character’s key life events: 
For purposes of this story, her key life events were:
Her decision to break a rule about dating in college.
Her initial decision was to violate her agreement with her father to get her master's degree and work for him, and instead marry Evan and follow him to Chicago.
Her divorce from Evan.
Why did Sarah want to divorce Evan? 
Evan did not want to divorce Sarah. He was blindsided by Sarah's decision to divorce him. He thought they were fine and couldn't understand why she wanted a divorce.

Sarah loved Evan, there was no doubt about that. Yet, with Evan, she felt a pull on a part of her she had always managed to keep hidden from the world. This more feminine, affectionate side of her was unfamiliar and unsettling. It made her feel vulnerable and out of control, like she was letting her emotions govern her actions. 

She would watch other women, seemingly imprisoned by their feelings, and internally she would criticize, vow to herself that she would never succumb to such a thing. Yet with Evan, that critical eye was turned towards herself, and she found herself yearning to retreat to the safety of her structured plan and logical decisions. 

It wasn't that she hadn't found success with Evan, but she had long planned to work at her father's corporation, climb the ladder, and make a name for herself. The pull towards that old dream was like a siren's song, tugging at her heartstrings even as she lay in Evan's arms.

She knew Evan loved her deeply and would follow her anywhere she chose to go. But even as she cherished his devotion, she realized a bitter truth. They would never truly be in sync. Their hearts might beat in rhythm, but their lives were set to different tempos. She could not, would not, uproot Evan from his beloved Seattle, from his sister Liz with whom he shared a bond unlike any other. 

Sarah realized this geographical divide would create an emotional chasm between Evan and Liz, one she was unwilling to be responsible for. And so, when she decided to leave, she did not offer Evan a chance to negotiate. Not because she doubted his ability to convince her but precisely because she feared he would tap into her emotional core as he had before, and she would find herself deviating from her path once more.

Sarah was determined to follow her lifelong goals. She had love in her heart for Evan, but it was a love she was willing to sacrifice for her ambition. It was a hard choice, but she believed it was the right one. Not just for her but for Evan too. He may not have seen it at the time, but Sarah was convinced that the path she was choosing was one that led to a better future for both of them.
Name: Sarah Wilkins
Character Arc: 
Sarah's journey is atypical. It's a narrative that circles back to its origins, portraying the fulfillment of her own personal, independent ambitions.

At the start of her story, Sarah stands on the precipice of two life paths: one leading to a life of romantic love and the other to a world of boundless professional ambition. When Evan proposes, her emotional attachment to him sways her decision, and she chooses love over her life-long dreams, a decision that echoes throughout her story.

In the early phase of their marriage, Sarah immerses herself in building their corporation with Evan. While she consciously chooses to prioritize work, she loves Evan deeply, and the satisfaction derived from their shared success helps suppress her yearning for individual career growth.

As their business reaches stability and success under Liz's leadership, Sarah's suppressed ambitions resurface. The lull in the excitement of growing a business reveals the disparity in her and Evan's life desires. While Evan is content with their achievements and yearns for a life of leisure, Sarah yearns for more - more challenges, more growth, more ambition. 

This difference in their aspirations leads Sarah to a critical self-realization: she craves control over her own destiny, a path undiluted by emotional attachments. She chooses to reset her life course, even if it means ending her marriage with Evan. She initiates the divorce, a decision that Evan, comfortable in their life together, never saw coming.

Post-divorce, Sarah redirects her energy and focus towards her original goal. She obtains her master's degree and moves to Seattle to continue working in her father's corporation. Despite the occasional loneliness that accompanies her choice, she acknowledges and accepts it as a consequence of her decision.

Witnessing Evan find happiness with Chloe is a bitter-sweet moment for Sarah. She still loves Evan, but she understands that her decision to divorce was necessary for her personal fulfillment.

Sarah's arc concludes where it initially began, with the realization that her lifelong ambitions are her primary source of fulfillment. She comes full circle, returning to her initial path, with a deeper understanding of herself and what she wants from life. Despite the emotional challenges and the loneliness that accompany her chosen path, Sarah stands by her decision, unyielding and unregretful, as she moves forward in her life of chosen independence and professional success.
In narrative format, provide details about this character: 
Sarah Wilkins is an embodiment of sophistication and elegance, a captivating blend of a businesswoman's poise and a supermodel's allure. Towering at a height of 5 feet 9 inches, she carries herself with a grace that reflects her confidence and a commanding presence that is impossible to ignore.
Her long, blonde hair, a cascade of golden silk, frames her strikingly beautiful face perfectly. Often, it is styled immaculately, falling in gentle waves over her shoulders, or swept into an elegant updo that suits her professional demeanor. She is meticulous about her appearance, always ensuring she is well-groomed and put together.
The most arresting feature on her face is her steely blue-gray eyes, which are both captivating and intense. They are windows to her sharp intellect, often sparkling with determination and ambition. Her eyes hold a magnetic charm that draws people towards her, making her presence even more impactful.
Sarah's supermodel-like physique is another testament to her diligence. She has a slender and toned body, which is a result of her disciplined lifestyle and dedicated commitment to health and fitness. 
Her skin is a healthy glow, thanks to her excellent self-care habits, and her teeth are pearly white and perfectly aligned, contributing to her radiant smile that can brighten up any room. The way she takes care of herself reflects her disciplined personality and her emphasis on presenting her best self to the world.
On the surface, Sarah appears cold and rigid, a formidable businesswoman who keeps her emotions tucked away. Guided by her father's advice, she has maintained a professional distance from her employees, often coming off as aloof. Her interactions with Evan and Liz are perhaps the only instances where the faintest traces of warmth and humility seep through her icy exterior, offering a rare glimpse into the softer side of her otherwise steely persona. The apparent contradiction between her physical beauty and her reserved nature only makes Sarah Wilkins an even more intriguing character.</Text>
            <Notes>She wears designer dresses to all major social events.
She wears designer skirt and pantsuits to work.
Her jewelry is expensive, except for the one necklace and panted she cherishes most – the one Evan gave her on their first date. Even though it's inexpensive and not particularly beautiful, she still wears it every day to work.
Even her jeans and tops are designer. 
The only clothes that are designer are her workout clothes.

I am currently working on Sarah's profile. I wanted to include a narrative description. Please write a description of Sarah given the following bullet points.
Sarah was an only child.
Her birth/maiden name is Sarah Wilkins.
From birth, her parents raised her for success.
There were no play dates or dance classes for Sarah. Instead, her parents focused on academics. As a child, Sarah devoted extracurricular time to expanding her knowledge base, primarily by reading non-fiction educational books.
Sarah was the valedictorian of her high school and graduated top of her class in college.
Her focus in high school was academics. Her pre-college resume was formidable. She could get a full scholarship at any university in the country. She planned to attend a prestigious Ivy League university for her master's degree. However, she attended the University of Illinois for undergrad work because that was her father's alma mater.
Sarah's father played a dominant role in his marriage. His wife was submissive and dutiful.
Sarah respected her father.
Sarah's relationship with her father was more mentor/mentee than father/daughter.
The Wilkins household was stoic. The three household members respected each other, but affection was minimal. There weren't many hugs in Sarah's childhood.
Sarah embraced the way that she was raised. She had an extraordinarily high IQ, and her parent's method of reading her for success made a lot of sense.
In high school, Sarah could never understand why girls spent so much time talking about boys. However, she did find herself occasionally being attracted to a boy.
She did date a few times in high school but did it more to find out why girls spend so much energy on boys than it was because she was interested in them.
When it was time for college, Sarah promised herself she would not get caught up in the social trappings that college life can bring. She decided to avoid all romantic relationships until she achieved her master's degree and was ready to start her professional life.

I am working on explaining Sarah's motivation. Please write a narrative based on the following bullet points:
Sarah's future was written in stone before she started high school.
She expected to graduate valedictorian of her high school class.
She expected to be top of her class at the University of Illinois and whatever Ivy League school she decided to attend for her master's degree.
She was to spend her free time on philanthropic endeavors during her college years. In part to give back to the community. But also to build contacts and relationships with other wealthy men and women in the business world.
After she obtained her master's degree, she would take a position at her father's corporation. She wouldn't be starting at an entry-level, but also wouldn't start in upper management. Her father wanted her to climb the corporate ladder through effort, diligence, and skill – not nepotism.
Sarah was particularly interested in expanding her father's corporate dealings overseas. Her father's company had a minimal presence outside the United States. She was looking to make a name for herself through successful expansion internationally.
Ultimately, her final goal was to replace her father as the CEO of his multimillion-dollar corporation when he retired.
As far as her personal life, she had decided to one day marry a successful man similar to her father. However, while she respected her mother, Sarah did not want to play the role of a supportive wife. She wanted to play the role of an equal partner in a marriage. She wanted one and only one child that she would raise in the way that she was raised.

Please provide a narrative to explain why Sarah asked for a divorce with Evan giving the following bullet points:
Sarah loved Evan very much.
He was the only one who could tap into that more feminine, affectionate part of her that was inaccessible and invisible to everyone else.
Sarah felt uncomfortable with the emotional aspects that Evan exposed. She didn't like feeling controlled by her emotions. She felt critical of other women who seemed imprisoned by their feelings and didn't want that.
She regretted not following her lifelong goals. Even though she was successful in her own right with Evan, she craved returning to her plan and working at her father's corporation.
She knew that Evan loved her and would follow her anywhere she went. But in her heart of hearts, she realized they would never be in sync. Additionally, she couldn't move him so from his sister, Liz. Evan Liz had such a special bond. 
Seattle was so far from Chicago, and Sarah worried that would negatively impact Evan and Liz's brother-sister connection.
She walked out on Evan without attempting to negotiate with him as she always had in past differences because she knew he would connect with her deeper emotional self like he did when he asked her to marry him. She knew Evan, well-meaning as he would have been, would have caused her to make a decision she would later regret. 
She was committed to achieving her lifelong goal; even her love for Evan would not stand in the way. To her credit, she considered this the best decision for Evan, even if he couldn't see it at the time.

            <Title>0100 Sarah is Late for Class</Title>
            <Synopsis>In the unique setting of an underground library, Sarah Wilkins loses track of time while engrossed in an audio seminar. Realizing she's late for teaching her Business-101 class, she quickly packs her belongings and rushes toward the library's exit, her seminar still playing in her ears. The scene ends as she reaches the stairs, setting the stage for a chain of unforeseen events.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah sat amidst the hum of the Undergrad Library, the quiet symphony of fervent academia filling her ears. Encased in the concrete womb of the subterranean structure, she was blissfully unaware of the perfect sunny day unfolding outside. Around her, the library pulsed with the breath of student life, the symbiosis of quiet studiousness and simmering energy all too evident. It was more than a collection of books and periodicals, it was a cocoon of culture and knowledge, a shrine built in deference to the neighboring Morrow Plots, whose shadows were untouched by any construction.

Her earbuds funneled the animated voice from her audio seminar into her consciousness, an insightful monologue on expanding businesses internationally. In the intoxicating current of ideas, she found herself swept away, forgetting the real world around her. As a teaching assistant for Business-101, she often sought such engrossing material to keep her lessons engaging for her first-year students. 'There's so much these students can learn from this,' she thought to herself, an idea for the next class already blossoming in her mind.

A sudden glance at her watch shattered her serenity. She was late. The usual orchestration of time had somehow slipped, and the maestro of her schedule had vanished in the wake of the riveting seminar. Her heart thumped in her chest, a drum echoing the rhythm of her rising panic. 'I can't believe I lost track of time,' she chastised herself.

In a flurry of motion, she collected her belongings, the objects seeming to move in slow motion as she attempted to regain control of the runaway tempo of time. Books, pens, her tablet, all swept into her bag in a chaotic ballet of haste. With the last few minutes of her audio seminar still playing, she decided to leave her earbuds in. The outside world muted, she felt her way through the sounds of her heartbeat and the dwindling minutes of the seminar.

Her footsteps echoed against the concrete stairs leading to the exit, each one amplifying her frantic rush. Just as she was about to push the heavy door, she hesitated, her breath hitching in her chest. She had left the safety of the library's cocoon, and what awaited her outside, only time would tell. 

(This scene was written with elements of Danielle Steele's style, focusing on the internal thoughts and feelings of the main character, along with detailed descriptions of the setting and events.)</Text>

            <Text>Location Profile: 
Name of the place: Champaign Hotel Grand Ballroom 
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign
Type of place: Hotel Party Room/Ballroom
Capacity: Accommodates 30-40 people
What role does this setting play in the story?
Guido and Evan take charge of this grand space, leasing it for a night to host an exuberant post-graduation party. The Champaign Hotel Grand Ballroom transforms from a simple gathering spot into an integral setting for a pivotal moment in the story.
It's within the enchanting walls of this ballroom that Evan musters the courage to propose to Sarah. Amidst the celebration and festive sounds, the room falls silent for a brief, magical moment as Evan expresses his love and commitment to Sarah.
Adding an unexpected twist to the evening, Sarah is taken aback when she spots her parents amidst the crowd, their presence a surprise to her. This eventful night also presents the sole opportunity for Evan to meet Sarah's parents. The interactions and emotions unfolding within the grandeur of this ballroom deepen the narrative, as relationships are explored, and bonds are solidified.
Description:
Tucked within the sophisticated Champaign Hotel, the Grand Ballroom offers a spacious and stylish venue for lively college parties. It blends traditional elegance with contemporary design elements, exuding a vibrant and welcoming ambiance, perfect for a memorable evening.
Upon entering the room, the sight of a small, but professionally-equipped stage draws immediate attention. It's an intimate platform set against a textured backdrop, spotlighted by a couple of sleek stage lights hanging from the ceiling. This area serves as the announcement center, creating a focal point in the room and drawing the crowd together for key moments.
The dance floor, a significant feature of the ballroom, stretches out invitingly in front of the stage. Its polished wooden surface, reflecting the soft, colorful glow of strategically placed LED lights, tempts even the most reserved attendees to let loose and dance. Positioned to encourage interaction and fun, the dance floor becomes the heart of the party, pulsating with energy and laughter.
The ballroom's high ceiling enhances the sense of space, accommodating the 30-40 party-goers comfortably. A series of chic, crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling, casting a soft, inviting light throughout the room. Ambient wall sconces complement the chandeliers, ensuring the room is well-lit yet retains an intimate feel.
Round tables draped in crisp, white linens and adorned with minimalistic centerpieces are strategically arranged around the dance floor. Each seats four to six guests, promoting comfortable conversation and interaction among the party-goers. 
On one side of the room, a long, buffet-style table offers a selection of refreshments and finger foods, ideal for refueling during the festivities. On the opposite side, a well-stocked bar serves a variety of drinks, tended by a friendly, skilled bartender. 
Despite its formal setting, the Grand Ballroom exudes a youthful charm, making it a fitting location for a gathering of exuberant college students. The setting, while sophisticated, is infused with an infectious energy that inspires camaraderie, fun, and perhaps a touch of romance among its young guests.

            <Title>0120 Waiting Game</Title>
            <Text>Evan stood outside the library's imposing entrance, feeling his heartbeat quicken every time the doors swung open. It was Monday, the sky overcast, threatening to rain. Despite the previous Friday's disappointment, he was back, leaning against a rough tree trunk, gaze unwavering from the library's entrance and the surrounding area.
A lock of blonde hair, a familiar stride, a laugh that held the same timbre, each sent his heart fluttering like a loose leaf in the wind. Each false alarm was a jolt, a harsh pull back to reality as the girl exiting the library was not Sarah. His hopes, like a yo-yo on a frayed string, soared and plummeted with each passing minute.
A drizzle started about half an hour into his wait. As the heavens wept, Evan stayed rooted to his spot, his jacket growing heavier with the weight of the rainwater. He sought the shelter of the trees, occasionally shifting under awnings to minimize the downpour's effects. Yet, he refused to stray far from the spot, ensuring a clear view of the library entrance and the place where they first kissed. His efforts to stay dry were as futile as catching raindrops in a sieve.
After a couple of hours, a familiar figure emerged from the campus crowd. Guido. His approach was as nonchalant as his question.
&quot;No luck?” Guido asked, leaning against a tree beside Evan.
With his head down, Evan replied, &quot;No, I haven't seen her.&quot;
Guido, ever the pragmatic one, offered his version of consolation. &quot;Sorry, bro. Don't stress it. There are plenty of fish in the sea.&quot;
&quot;I don't want to fish in the sea. She's the only one for me,&quot; Evan said, his words seeming to sink into the sodden ground.
Guido shook his head, &quot;I don't get you, bro. You got women lined up to be with you, and you're stressing over a girl whose name you don't know? You should adopt my style – no strings attached, no drama.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, and no hope for love,&quot; Evan retorted, staring into the distance.
Guido laughed at that, a soft chuckle that was half admiration, half disbelief. &quot;My friend, ever the hopeless romantic.&quot;
&quot;I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm just... I'm just...just…&quot; Evan stammered, frustration coloring his voice, &quot;I don't know what I am. I just know that I have to see my Cinderella again.&quot;
In his own unconventional way, Guido offered comfort through a joke. &quot;Let's leave the matching glass slipper search for another day. Come on, let's head back to our place. We’ll knock down a few beers and watch baseball. The Cubs actually have a chance for the playoffs this year!&quot;
Evan remained silent, his gaze still fixed on the library.
&quot;You'll feel a lot better with a cold brew in your hand and a Cubs victory on the TV. I’ll tell you what, after the game, we’ll try to figure a way to get her name,&quot; Guido continued, trying to lift Evan's spirits.
Evan remained unresponsive.
&quot;How hard can it be to find the most beautiful girl on campus?&quot; Guido teased, aiming to elicit a smile.
It worked. A small smile played at the corners of Evan's lips. &quot;I suppose you're right. I'll bump into her sooner or later.&quot;
&quot;Exactly! Let's chill at home, and we’ll scour the Internet when the game ends,&quot; Guido urged.
&quot;Thanks, dude. I feel better already,&quot; Evan acknowledged, his voice carrying a hint of relief.
With that, the two friends set off, the rain pattering a softer rhythm on the pavement behind them. As they walked away, the library doors swung open once again, pouring out another group of students, their laughter merging with the murmur of the rain.</Text>

            <Title>0105 Evan and Guido in the Quad</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan and Guido are playing Frisbee in the Quad. Evan decides to head to the library for extra study time to keep his grade point average above 3.0 – a promise he made to his sister Liz.</Synopsis>
            <Text>In the heart of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, bathed in the warm embrace of a sun-kissed day, the enchanting Quad stood, a gathering place for dreams and destinies. The Quad's lush greenery and vibrant flowers whispered stories of budding friendships and lifelong connections.

Amidst this picturesque backdrop, Evan and Guido strolled, their laughter filling the air like music notes in a symphony of camaraderie. They played a spirited game of Frisbee, each throw and catch a testament to their unwavering bond.

Evan's heart danced with joy, basking in the radiant glow of his sister Liz's love. She was his North Star, guiding him with an unyielding promise he had made to her - to keep his grades above a 3.0. Liz's belief in him fueled his determination, and he embraced every challenge with the fire of devotion.

As the sun slowly dipped towards the horizon, casting a golden hue over the Quad, Evan decided it was time to head to the library. Guido nodded understandingly, knowing the importance of Evan's dedication. He offered a teasing remark, &quot;Off to hit the books, huh? Better not keep the library waiting for its star pupil!&quot;

Evan chuckled, playfully shoving Guido's shoulder. &quot;Yeah, you know me, always living up to my academic prowess.&quot;

Guido raised an eyebrow, a grin tugging at the corners of his lips. &quot;Yeah, yeah, Mr. Smarty-pants, go get 'em! But don't forget, I'll be waiting for you to join the fun later!&quot;

Evan waved him off with a laugh, grateful for Guido's lighthearted support. As he walked away, he couldn't help but feel blessed by the treasured friendships that surrounded him. Liz, Guido, and the memories they shared were the anchor of his college experience, and he cherished every moment.

The Quad hummed with life, witnessing yet another chapter of Evan and Guido's adventure. In the tender light of twilight, the promise of unbreakable friendships and the pursuit of dreams lingered like a beautiful melody, ready to resonate through the ages.

            <Title>0122 Evan is a Man With a Plan</Title>
            <Text>Evan Vaughn drove his seasoned Subaru SUV, the odometer proudly displaying over a hundred thousand miles, towards the college campus. The weather was a replica of that unforgettable day when he first met Sarah, a perfect day where the sun beamed merrily and the air held just the right amount of warmth.

Inside the car, the radio played an upbeat tune, setting the rhythm of the morning. Last night, the Cubs had scored a win, and it felt like a personal victory. Life was shining bright.

His late-night conversation with Guido played back in his mind. Guido had swayed him from the exhaustive internet search for his enigmatic girl and had candidly shown Evan the stark image of himself - sitting alone in the rain, hoping for a woman who might not turn up. His friend's words held a mirror to the desperation that had been lurking, and it wasn't a pleasant sight.

A night of sound sleep had refreshed Evan, bringing him an idea that felt like a sudden revelation, a divine epiphany. It seemed as though the universe had silently slipped this seed of thought into his mind. &quot;Sarah,&quot; he remembered, &quot;always dressed like a professor. She could be a bookworm. And where do bookworms hibernate? The library. Obvious!&quot;

This new insight filled Evan with a wave of optimism. He had a plan now, a strategy. The library was his destination. On reaching the campus, he would check the location of their first kiss. If she wasn't there, he wouldn't spend hours outside waiting. Instead, he would head straight to the undergrad library, certain that's where he'd find her.

As the university campus came into view, he parked his vehicle and stepped out, breathing in the welcoming scent of early fall. With the car door closing behind him, Evan felt a surge of confidence, his excitement carefully tamed, replaced with determination. No longer was he a man lost in his pursuit; he was a man with a plan, a plan to find Sarah.

Author's style: Direct and energetic, focusing on inner dialogue and sensory description to establish the character's state of mind and emotions.

            <Text>For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, their first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is under way. They've never met, as their social circles don't intersect. Evan, a charismatic, athletic young man, commands popularity not by choice, but by virtue of his outgoing personality. Despite his natural allure, he remains grounded thanks to the guidance from his saintly sister, Liz, treating everyone with kindness.
Evan isn't the most diligent student, preferring the outdoors to the confines of classrooms and libraries. However, to uphold a promise to Liz, he's striving for a minimum GPA of 3.0. As he enters his senior year, his grades are teetering on this threshold, and he is compelled to trade Frisbee games for study sessions at the undergrad library.
Contrastingly, Sarah is a stellar student, poised to graduate at the top of her class. As a business major and teaching assistant, she considers the library her sanctuary, often losing herself in riveting audio seminars, like one on international business strategies. One day, engrossed in her seminar, she realizes she's running late for a class she's teaching. In her rush, she neglects her surroundings and dashes towards a flight of stairs without a handrail.
Evan, heading her way, spots the impending accident. He calls out to her, but she doesn't hear him. He makes a dash to intercept her before she reaches the stairs, managing to catch her just in time. This unexpected encounter leads to a spontaneous, passionate kiss. 
Sarah, brought up with a single-minded focus on academics and preparing to take over her father's business, has little experience with romance. She had sworn off any romantic entanglements until she completed her Master’s degree and embarked on her professional journey. 
In a whirlwind, Sarah leaves without providing Evan her name or contact. Later, Evan manages to track her down, returning a pair of glasses she had left behind and charming her into taking a break at the food court. Despite her initial hesitation, she gives in to Evan’s allure. 
Their encounter at the food court leaves Sarah questioning herself as she witnesses Evan’s popularity, especially among the female students. Feeling out of place, she retreats, but Evan convinces her to agree to a date. Uncertain about dating norms, Sarah enlists the help of one of her top students, Katie, to modernize her look and prep her for the date. 
During their date, Sarah proposes a business-like arrangement with Evan, setting rules and expectations that prioritize her academics. Evan, who has been smitten since their first encounter, happily agrees. As they continue to see each other, Sarah allows herself to experience romance and affection, while Evan, with Sarah’s help, becomes a better student. 
Their senior year unfolds beautifully. Sarah expands her social circle, and Evan lands a good job in Chicago. As graduation approaches, however, Sarah grapples with her future choices – Ivy League schools for her Master's or staying with Evan. Unbeknownst to her, Evan is planning to propose at the graduation party, inviting her parents for the surprise.
Sarah, who has downplayed the seriousness of their relationship to her parents, is taken aback by Evan’s proposal. She fears disappointing her father by deviating from her initial plan. Following the party, her father presents her with two choices – follow Evan to Chicago and build a life there, or stick to the original plan of pursuing her Master's and eventually joining her father’s business. If she chooses Evan, her father will cut off financial support.
Sarah is torn between her love for Evan and the commitment to her father. Despite the complexities, her heart prevails, and she chooses to build a life with Evan in Chicago.</Text>

            <Title>0116 Evan Hopes for Sarah's Return</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan stayed put, sitting on the stairs where he had just kissed the woman of his dreams. He hoped that she returned to the scene of the kiss. When she didn't show, he returned to the Quad to tell Guido all about what had just happened.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan's heart ached with longing as he paced back and forth outside the entrance to the undergrad library. Every part of his soul yearned for the touch of the woman he had just kissed, and the place where their lips had met seemed to burn in memory. The kiss had been impromptu, passionate, an undeniable force of destiny. Now, she was gone, and all he had left of her were her broken glasses.
The Morrow Plots beckoned him with their lush serenity, and he walked over to them to clear his head. He couldn't stray too far, couldn't risk missing her return. He hoped that somehow, she would come back, if not for him, then at least to retrieve what she had left behind.
An hour passed, an eternity filled with bittersweet recollections and fervent prayers for Sarah's return. Finally, he made a resolution. He would fix her glasses, return to this very spot tomorrow, and hope that destiny would grant them a second meeting.
Energized by his decision, Evan sought out Guido at The Quad, his friend who was forever engaged in the pursuit of romance. Guido was easy to find, his charismatic demeanor drawing the attention of two sophomore coeds. They were just the latest in Guido's endless quest for love, or at least, affection.
Without a second thought, Evan grabbed Guido by the shirt and pulled him away, his eyes alight with excitement.
&quot;I gotta tell you something!&quot; Evan exclaimed, the words bubbling up from deep within him.
Guido was indignant but curious, &quot;Hey, Man! Why'd you do that? I had those two in the palm of my hand.&quot;
&quot;You did not. Never mind about that. I got something to tell you!&quot; Evan's voice was full of passion, and his eyes sparkled with the memory of the kiss.
The exchange between the two friends was filled with disbelief, humor, good-natured ribbing, and, ultimately, a connection that transcended mere words. Evan's revelation of the kiss, the woman's flight, the broken glasses, all led to Guido's surprise and playful skepticism. They even named her Cinderella, an apt metaphor for the fleeting encounter that had left Evan utterly spellbound.
&quot;What are you gonna do now?&quot; Guido finally asked, his voice a blend of sarcasm and genuine concern.
&quot;I am going to fix her glasses and try to find her tomorrow,&quot; Evan replied, determination etched in every line of his face.
Guido, ever the lover, saw another opportunity and declined Evan's invitation to the mall, leaving Evan to make the journey alone, his heart full of hope and anticipation.
As Evan headed toward his car, the world seemed to come alive with possibility. The longing in his chest was a living thing, a pulse of desire that connected him to the woman he had kissed, to Cinderella. Tomorrow, he would find her, and his life would never be the same again.

            <Title>Mary Higgins Clark</Title>
            <Text>In the sprawling campus of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the destinies of two distinct individuals, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, were dramatically intertwined. 
Evan Vaughn was the golden boy of the university, a charismatic senior with an appealing athletic build. Having been reared by his gentle sister Liz, he was known for his humility and respect towards everyone, regardless of their status. His performance in academics was unfortunately mediocre, not in line with his athletic prowess. Despite this, a promise made to his sister propelled him to strive for a 3.0 GPA, exchanging his leisurely times with his friend Guido for long hours in the library.
Sarah Wilkins, on the other hand, was an epitome of academic excellence. She carried the ambition to graduate as a class valedictorian. Libraries were her sanctuaries, where she would lose herself in intricate audio seminars and prepare for her teaching assistant role in a Business-101 class. Slated to take over her father's corporation, she was convinced that any romantic involvements should be put off until after her Master's degree.
Fate intervened when an absent-minded Sarah nearly stumbled down a flight of steps. It was Evan's quick instincts that saved her, their unexpected collision ending in a passionate, unexpected kiss. Sarah's glasses were left behind in the wake of her hasty retreat.
A few days later, Evan sought her out, bringing along her repaired glasses. Despite her initial reluctance, she found herself agreeing to a casual meeting in the food court. Amidst the throngs of people that flocked around Evan, Sarah's insecurities surfaced and she left abruptly. Yet, after another kiss filled with electric intensity, she decided to give their relationship a chance.
To aid in her preparation for the date, Sarah turned to Katie Andrews, a sincere student from her class. Through a fresh makeover, Sarah began to reconsider her earlier decision against dating in college. But if she was going to venture into the tumultuous sea of romance, it would have to be on her terms.
Evan happily agreed to her conditions. They embarked on a thrilling journey, with Sarah gradually discovering her romantic side and Evan improving in his academics under her tutelage. While they reveled in the present, uncertainty lingered over their future, with Sarah's indecisiveness about pursuing further studies at an Ivy League school and Evan planning a secret proposal.
At their graduation party, Evan's unexpected proposal stirred up a whirlwind of emotions in Sarah. Her practicality made her hesitate, but love won over. Yet, the thought of confronting her father, whom she had deceived about her involvement with Evan, haunted her.
Her father then presented a challenge. She could either pursue her Master's degree while accompanying Evan to Chicago or stick to her initial plan. If she chose Evan, she would lose her father's financial support. 
Sarah was torn between two futures. She knew of Evan's commitment to his sister and his promising job opportunity in Chicago, and she didn't want to impede his progress. Now she was faced with a difficult decision: adhere to the path she had meticulously planned or surrender to the whirlwind of love. After a period of deep reflection, Sarah chose Evan, allowing love to triumph over her practical considerations.</Text>

A charming little Thai restaurant tucked away in a quieter corner of town. The place was an intimate cocoon, exuding an enchanting blend of modern aesthetic and traditional Thai decor. Warm, golden lighting cast a soft glow over the well-worn wooden tables and chairs, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. 
Ornate, hand-carved wooden panels adorned the walls, depicting scenes of Thai mythology and culture. Splashes of vibrant silk fabrics, used as table runners and curtains, added rich pops of color, complemented by the sweet aroma of exotic spices wafting from the kitchen.
The centerpiece of the establishment was a small wishing well situated near the waiting area. Crafted from aged stone and moss, it was an unexpected touch that lent an air of whimsy to the place. Trickling water cascaded down, producing a soothing melody that added to the tranquil ambiance. A collection of coins glistened at the bottom, tossed by hopeful patrons making silent wishes.

Katie is a student in the business-101 course that Sarah teaches as a teacher assistant. Sarah has not been on a date since she was 16 years old and is unsure what to wear to her date with Evan. She remembered how Katie had complimented her a week before and noticed that Katie was sporting a style that Sarah thought she would have if she were a &quot;normal college girl.&quot; 
After class, Sarah asked Katie if she could help her do a makeover for her date with Evan. Katie is thrilled at the opportunity. Katie asked Sarah to pick her up after her last class around 1 o'clock, and they ultimately bonded together while preparing Sarah for her date.
In narrative format, provide details about this character: 
Katie Andrews is an eighteen-year-old business freshman at the University of Illinois. She's an ENFP, typified by her contagious, bubbly personality, and a seemingly limitless capacity to care for others, making her fit the Caregiver archetype perfectly. Katie is instantly likeable, projecting an aura of warmth and friendliness that draws people to her. Her helpful nature has endeared her to many, including her business-101 teacher assistant, Sarah.
Physically, Katie is of average height at 5’4”, with a few extra pounds on her frame that do not detract from her overall youthful appeal. Her fair skin tone offers a contrast to the vibrant pink of her hair - a color she deliberately chose to replace her natural brown hue. The straight cut of her hair, ending neatly at the nape of her neck, adds a touch of modern edginess to her look.
Despite not owning a vehicle, Katie's spirit of adventure is not dampened. She is a good student and manages to balance her studies with her love for socializing. Fashion-wise, Katie is casual and modern, favoring comfortable, affordable, and contemporary clothes - the perfect style for a college coed. Her sense of style catches the attention of Sarah, who sees in Katie the kind of 'normal college girl' look she desires.

            <Notes>Alternative Description:
Katie Andrews is a striking figure in the freshman class of the Business department at the University of Illinois. At 18, she embodies the energy and optimism of youth, her personality as vibrant as the pink shade she chose for her hair - a bold deviation from her original brown. With a height of 5’4” and a slightly fuller frame, she exudes a sense of self-assuredness that comes from acceptance of her body, which carries a few extra pounds but is in no way heavy.
Her defining feature isn't physical, though. It's her personality. As a perfect representation of an ENFP Myers-Briggs type, she's warm, friendly, and helpful, always ready to lend a hand or a listening ear. Coupled with this is a bubbly personality that makes her approachable and instantly likeable. These traits align seamlessly with the Caregiver archetype, a role she embraces without hesitation.
As a student, Katie excels, striking the right balance between her academic obligations and her social life. She's known for her fun, casual demeanor and contemporary sense of style, which is as affordable and comfortable as it is trendy. Her clothing choices make her a quintessential college coed, projecting a relaxed and modern vibe that catches the attention of her business-101 teacher assistant, Sarah.
Without a car, Katie's spirit of adventure isn't hindered. Her joy for life is infectious, and her ability to adapt and make the most of every situation is admirable. When Sarah asks for her help in preparing for a date with Evan, Katie is more than happy to step in. This request leads to a fun-filled afternoon of shopping and bonding as they prepare Sarah for her date.
Throughout their shared experience, Katie shows her genuine character and caregiving qualities, further strengthening her bond with Sarah. Through this connection, she plays a key role in Sarah's narrative, providing support and friendship in a time of uncertainty. Her place in the story is not just as a supporting character, but as a reminder of the warmth, vivacity, and compassion that human connections can offer.</Notes>

What is the character's role in the novel? 
Sarah was aware of the graduation party, but she was oblivious to the plaque that Guido and Evan had arranged for her, and more importantly, she had no clue about Evan's impending proposal. The final surprise was that Evan had invited her parents. They were kept in the dark about the proposal but were informed about the plaque presentation and asked to keep their visit a secret from Sarah. Evan's primary reason for their presence was for them to witness the proposal, a fact he kept hidden.
What Evan did not know was that Sarah had been less than honest with her parents about her relationship with him. She had mentioned Evan to them but had understated the depth of her feelings for him, and his for her. In her father's mind, Evan was merely a social companion for Sarah, and he believed that after Sarah went to an Ivy League school, they would naturally drift apart. She gave the impression that her relationship with Evan was casual.
From the back of the party room, Sarah's parents watched the unexpected proposal unfold. Caught off guard, Sarah accepted Evan's proposal in the presence of all their friends. Her father's disappointment was evident in his expression as he exited the room. Despite having to put on a happy facade as the newly-engaged woman for the rest of the party, Sarah could not shake the image of her father's disapproval and the impending confrontation.
At the conclusion of the festivities, Sarah headed to her parents' hotel room, dreading the upcoming meeting. She could manage anger, but her father's evident disappointment was a far more challenging hurdle. Nevertheless, Sarah stood firm in her decision to marry Evan. Although her mind usually guided her decisions, this time, her heart was in control.
In their meeting, her father did not display anger. Instead, he proposed a deal: he would continue to support her financially for one more month, allowing her time to make the 'right' decision, which in his eyes involved obtaining a Master's degree from a reputable Ivy League or business school and then returning to work for him in Seattle.
Her parents agreed that Evan seemed like a nice young man, but they did not believe he was the right match for Sarah. They stated that they would bless the marriage only if she achieved her Master's degree and returned to Seattle; Evan was welcome to accompany her. However, if Sarah deviated from this plan, her father would terminate his financial support.
Though some emotion escaped Sarah, the conversation remained civil. Sarah found her father's offer fair but also knew that Evan had already secured a job in Chicago and that he wanted to stay close to his sister. 
While she respected her father's stance, he, in turn, respected her decision, even though he disagreed with it. He, however, refused to provide financial support. Yet, he didn't sever ties with Sarah. They continued to stay in contact, and a few years later, when she and Evan were ready to start a business, he loaned them the startup capital. After all, he still loved his daughter.
The business proved to be a success, allowing Sarah to promptly repay the loan with interest.
Notes:
Born on a farm to farmer parents in central Illinois.
His father was a no-nonsense man, and so was Jack.
He met his wife, Mildred, in high school and married her after college.
He had minimal time to enjoy free time in his childhood preteen years. He needed to help his family by attending to duties on the farm.
He got a paying job when he was old enough and started saving for college. 
Jack believed that hard work would win the day. It was difficult for him to watch his father work his hand to the bone to make ends meet while other kids in school had lazy, overweight fathers with white-collar jobs who made triple as much.
Jack didn't want to be a struggling farmer, nor did he want to be a lazy white-collar worker. He wanted the best of both worlds. He intended to earn his wealth, embodying a farmer’s work ethic and the determination of a money-minded entrepreneur. He knew college was vital.
He went to the University of Illinois because he could remain living at home as it was nearby.
He scraped by getting loans and working long hours to pay for tuition.
He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business. 
Tired of working for others, with the support of his wife, Jack started his own business at just 25 years of age.
He experienced significant growth year after year – eventually watching his company grow into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.
He would never admit it, but he really wanted a son. He was secretly disappointed when his only child was to be a girl, Sarah.
Soon enough, he embraced his daughter. She showed signs of brilliance from an extremely early age. She accomplished all her childhood milestones well ahead of time. He decided to mentor Sarah as he would have a son.
Shortly after speaking her first words, he began to prepare her to run the company in his place one day.
This work for Sarah. She never felt cheated that she didn't have many friends or spent more time reading books than playing outside. 
Occasionally, she would want to join in on the fun, and she tried. Her parents never forced anything on her that she didn't like. If She asked for a play date or trip to the park, they accommodated her.
Even to the point where, at 16, Sarah went to her mom and dad and said she wanted to see what it was like to have a boyfriend. Instead of being upset, her father took her to the store and bought condoms. He told her that if she was going to explore her sexuality, he wanted her to be safe. It was in an emotional bond of any kind. It was just responsible, rational thinking.
It wasn't that he didn't love Sarah. He did, and Sarah loved him back. He lived a tough life and wanted Sarah to be tough, so love was never expressed through affection. Even when hugs were exchanged, it always looked and felt a little awkward.
In narrative format, provide details about this character::
Jack Wilkins is a tall, slender man in his mid-60s, with blue eyes and gray hair, resembling actor James Cromwell. He carries the no-nonsense demeanor instilled in him by his farmer father, a man who worked tirelessly to make ends meet. Born and raised on a farm in central Illinois, Jack was no stranger to hard work from a young age. He recognized early on that he did not want to follow in his father's footsteps, nor did he want to lead the life of what he saw as a complacent white-collar worker. 
For Jack, the path to prosperity laid in hard work and education. He maintained a job throughout his teenage years, saving money for college, all while continuing to contribute to the farm work. After high school, he attended the nearby University of Illinois, managing to cover his tuition through loans and working long hours.
After earning his bachelor's degree in business, Jack was ready to break free from working under others. At just 25, with the support of his high school sweetheart and now wife, Mildred, Jack embarked on his entrepreneurial journey. His determination and strong work ethic paid off as his business venture steadily grew, eventually turning into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.
Fatherhood came with its disappointments and joys for Jack. His initial disappointment of having a daughter was swiftly replaced by pride when his daughter, Sarah, demonstrated early signs of brilliance. Jack nurtured Sarah's intellect and ambition, preparing her to eventually take over the family business. His approach to parenting mirrored his overall disposition in life, rational, pragmatic, and perhaps a bit distant.
Jack's deep love for his daughter might not be easily discernible through his actions, but it has always been there. He desired Sarah to be tough and prepared for the world. The occasional awkwardness during their rare affectionate moments hinted at a man who struggled with expressing his emotions but never questioned the depth of his feelings. Jack Wilkins is not a man of many words, but his actions speak volumes about his character - a hard-working, pragmatic, and loving father who prepared his daughter for a world he knew was not always kind.</Text>

            <Synopsis>In what format would you like me to provide you with this information?</Synopsis>
            <Text>Any format that you find convenient would work, but here's a suggestion on how you could structure it:
Genre and Setting: Briefly describe the genre of the novel (romance, fantasy, sci-fi, etc.) and where and when the story is set. This could be as simple as &quot;modern day New York City&quot; or as complex as &quot;a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world where...&quot;
Characters: Give me a short description of your main characters, their personalities, motivations, backgrounds, etc. This can be bullet point form or in prose.
Main Conflict: Describe the primary problem or conflict the characters are facing. What is the goal they are trying to reach, and what obstacles are in their way?
Plot Structure: If you have a general idea of the plot structure, provide that. This could include major events or turning points in the novel.
Themes/Messages: Describe any themes or messages you wish to communicate through your story.
Here's an example of what this might look like:
Genre and Setting: This is a contemporary romance novel set in a small town in Maine.
Characters:
Anna: A successful businesswoman who returns to her hometown every year for Christmas. She's independent, smart, and a bit skeptical about love due to a heartbreak in her past.
Ben: Anna's high school sweetheart who still lives in the town. He's kind, patient, and never really got over Anna.
Main Conflict: Every year when Anna returns home, she and Ben reconnect, but they can never make it work due to their different lifestyles. They need to figure out if their love is worth sacrificing their individual dreams.
Plot Structure: Anna comes back for Christmas -&gt; Anna and Ben reconnect -&gt; They rekindle their romance -&gt; A conflict arises -&gt; They resolve the conflict -&gt; The cycle repeats the following year.
Themes/Messages: The book will explore themes of love, sacrifice, and whether it's possible to have it all - love, career, and personal dreams. </Text>

            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0121 Sarah Can't Concentrate
Characters: Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Undergrad Library - Remember that this library is underground with no windows.
Tone: Jumbled emotions and internal conflict.
Weather: The weather outside is perfect, but the library years underground, so the current state of the weather is not apparent.
Special Instructions: 
To keep the scene interesting, consider making Sarah's nervous energy and inability to focus cause her to perform menial tasks. Such as:
- Straighten up the work area in front of her.
- Clean her eyeglasses.
- Organize her purse
- Aimlessly searching through the aisles of books, pulling out and putting back books she knows she has no intention of reading.
- etc.

There is no outward dialogue in this scene. This is a set-up scene, so the reader will know Sarah's mindset in the moments before Evan finally finds her in the library. I really want the reader to feel like she's there with Sarah. Helpful to accomplish that goal will be a complete, vivid description of the inside of the library. The undergrad library is not overly quiet, although no one's allowed to yell or scream. I will provide a narrative to describe the library for this scene. Feel free to use it as is or modify it as needed.
Undergrad Library Description:
The Undergraduate Library was a flurry of activity and bright, relentless fluorescent lighting. Instead of a quiet sanctuary, it was a hub of engagement, a hive buzzing with the energy of youthful minds. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a stark, almost clinical glow over the rows of tables and chairs, making the room feel less like a typical library and more like a vibrant community center.
Groups of students huddled together at the tables, doing their best to keep their voices down but often failing in those efforts, as evidenced by scolded looks from others trying to study.
In corners and along the aisles between bookshelves, there were pockets of flirtation. Amidst the academic pursuit, the library also served as a social arena, a meeting point for like-minded individuals who could connect over shared study materials and the occasional whispered joke. A glance stolen across the study table, a shy smile in response to a witty remark, the quiet exchange of notes - these were as common in the library as textbooks and highlighters.
It was more than a library; it was a microcosm of college life, a blend of hard work, cooperation, and the undercurrent of budding romance. Students came for the books but stayed for the energy and camaraderie that hummed through the bright, lively room.
Sequence of Events:
I want a vivid description of the undergrad library as the backdrop for Sarah's internal conflict and lack of focus. 
Integrate Sarah's emotions and inner thoughts as you describe the library’s environment.
Somewhere in the scene, Sarah puts her hair in a bun. It's important that this happens for reasons that become apparent as our story continues.
For the first time in her college career, Sarah couldn't focus on her academic work. 
Whenever she tried to study, her mind wandered back to the kiss and the man who kissed her.
Sarah felt like an observer as her mind split in two. The left side of her brain reminded her of her vow to avoid romance, the right side embracing the feeling of every cell of her body craving romance, craving just one more kiss.
Sarah thought, “Is this what all women feel like when attracted to a man? How do they ever get anything done?&quot;
Try as she might, Sarah could not overcome the distraction her thoughts of Evan were causing.
She felt lucky that she was always way ahead in her schoolwork. Otherwise, she would be in trouble. She had accomplished virtually nothing in the days following the kiss.</Text>

What is the character's role in the novel? 
Liz doesn't appear in this book. But understanding her role in Evan's life is important. When Evan was a 10-year-old, his father left, and Liz, as a supportive big sister, becomes indispensable in his life.
Their unshakable, unbreakable bond extends far beyond this event. As Evan's mother works two jobs to make ends meet, Liz steps in, taking on multiple roles. She becomes a big sister, a mentor, and a surrogate mother for Evan.
Liz is always mature beyond her years. Even at 12 years old, she possesses the temperament and maturity of an adult. She embraces and thrives in her role, supporting Evan and their mom.
Under Liz's guidance, Evan transforms from a resentful, hotheaded, rambunctious child and teen into a man who everyone admires.
She wishes she could find a way to help Evan let go of his resentment and forgive his father.
The love and respect between Liz and Evan is as deep as any bond between siblings. Each would do anything for the other.</Text>

            <Text>I've broken up my story into three separate novels.
I consider the first novel a prequel, and I will call the first novel “Book 1.”
I consider the second novel the main one and will call it “Book 2.”
I consider the first novel a sequel, and I will call it “Book 3.”
Does that make sense?
Book 1 will be the smallest of the three books. I consider it a novella. It contains the back story of when Evan met Sarah. It begins on the day he meets Sarah and concludes on the day they get married.
It acts as a prologue and is optional for my readers. Does that make sense?
Book 2 begins with Evan and Sarah's divorce. Since the backstory prequel is optional, I will include minimal flashback scenes to catch the reader up.
After the divorce and the flashback scenes, the story will move into the inception of Evan's unique relationship strategy. In the report, Chloe names Evan's idea the &quot;Love, Annually Relationship Strategy.&quot; 
Book 2 will then follow Evan through his relationship one-year with Girl #1, Gabriella, Girl #2, and finally, his soulmate Chloe.
Book 2 will cover Evan and Chloe's fantastic year together, the breakup, and Chloe's return to Chicago, and cover her accident and recovery. Book 2 will and with two major pop resolved. First, Evan and Chloe get engaged. Second, the subplot of Liz's infertility is resolved in that she gets pregnant.
Does that make sense?
Absolutely, I apologize for the misunderstanding. Here is the corrected summary:
Book 3 starts with Chloe in the greenroom, moments away from her appearance on a popular talk show, much like Oprah's. She's there because of her published journals, which were originally gifts from Evan during her recovery. Titled &quot;Love, Annually,&quot; the book captivates the public with its honest exploration of personal emotions such as anger and jealousy and its introduction of Evan's unconventional approach to relationships.
As the book gains fame, Evan and Chloe build a dating website dedicated to their unique one-year relationship strategy. Chloe thrives in the limelight while Evan, being more reserved, only occasionally joins her for book signings.
Their relationship endures strain when Chloe considers a tubal ligation. Evan initially opposes the decision, leading to tension. However, Chloe eventually decides against the procedure, allowing them to reconcile and deepen their relationship.
The last stop on their book tour brings them to Portland, Oregon, near Sarah's home in Seattle. When Sarah unexpectedly appears, Chloe experiences a wave of jealousy that spirals into misunderstandings, leading to the abrupt end of her engagement with Evan.
Full of regret, Chloe later befriends Sarah and aids in repairing her public image. This act leads to her reconciliation with Evan, and they once again plan their wedding.
In a minor subplot, Guido finds love with Dakota. Following this diversion, the primary narrative continues with Evan and Chloe's wedding. During the vows, Chloe surprises everyone by expressing her desire to have two children with Evan, creating a ripple of shock and excitement at the wedding.
However, their happiness is challenged upon their return from the honeymoon when Evan is diagnosed with a rare bone disease. His life expectancy dramatically decreases unless he receives a bone marrow transplant, but no suitable donors are immediately available.
In response, Chloe collaborates with Evan's doctor to establish a bone marrow recruitment program, using her fame to encourage potential donors. An unlikely match emerges in Owen, a man Evan had helped in Book 2. Despite initial hesitance due to his wife's concerns, Owen eventually agrees to the procedure.
The transplant surgery is successfully carried out just in time. When Chloe visits Evan post-operation, she lightheartedly names him as his own savior, because it was his act of kindness that led to Owen becoming his donor. Evan, however, insists that Chloe is the real hero. Her tireless effort throughout their journey ensured his survival and made a significant impact on others awaiting a bone marrow transplant.
Book 3 concludes with Evan and Chloe, more deeply in love than ever before, preparing for their new life chapter, savoring every moment and cherishing their annual love – and beyond. The book beautifully ends their tale, which is filled with romance, introspection, drama, and triumph over real-world hardships.</Text>

            <Title>Sarahs Mother - Mildred Wilkins</Title>
            <Text>Name: Mildred Wilkins
Gender: Female
Age: Mid-60s
Current residence: Seattle, Washington
Vehicle Driven: Mercedes-Benz
Resembles: Actor Meryl Streep
Eye Color: Blue
Hair Color: Gray
Height: 5’6”
Body type: Slender
Relationships: Wife to Jack Wilkins. Mother of Sarah Wilkins.
Personality traits: 
In terms of brand archetypes, her would be considered a Caregiver.
Her Myers-Briggs archetype is INFJ.
Notes:
Born in central Illinois.
She met Jack in high school when she was a junior, and he was a senior.
She worked various low-paying jobs while Jack attended a nearby college.
They were married shortly after he graduated.
Mildred was a dutiful wife to an authoritative husband.
She was not in any way abused; Jack treated her well. It's just that he was the primary decision-maker on any critical decisions. Mildred and Jack were rarely out of sync, regardless of who made the decision.
She eventually became an assistant office manager, where Jack worked after college.
After a few years, Jack was ready to start his own company, and Mildred followed him. She worked almost as many hours as Jack doing whatever needed, from cleaning the office to managing the books.
The company grew quickly, and shortly after that, Sarah was born. Once Sarah was born, Mildred voted to be a mother and wife.
Mildred was a tad more expressive than her husband or daughter and often felt like a third wheel. That being said, she was fulfilled by her role as mother and wife and had no desire to return to the corporate world. She enjoyed her life after Sarah was born.
When there were times that she disagreed with Jack's decision, especially about Sarah's upbringing, she would speak up. However, if Jack pushed back, Mildred would bite her tongue and acquiesce.

Character Description: 
In her mid-60s, Mildred Wilkins exudes a quiet, dignified grace. Her eyes, a vibrant blue, mirror those of her husband, Jack, and their only child, Sarah. She possesses a slim figure, standing at a modest 5'6&quot;, and carries herself with an air of serene confidence. 
Born and raised in Central Illinois, Mildred's life took a significant turn when she met Jack during her junior year of high school. The pair were inseparable from then on. Even as Jack progressed through college, Mildred stood by him, juggling various low-paying jobs to support their budding relationship. Their bond solidified when they got married shortly after Jack's graduation.
Mildred was a steadfast companion to her authoritative husband, Jack. Their dynamic was harmonious, even though Jack predominantly held the reins of decision-making. Jack treated her with respect and kindness, never overstepping the boundaries into mistreatment or abuse.
Following Jack into the corporate world, Mildred worked alongside him in various roles, from office cleaning to bookkeeping. She proved herself to be versatile, a characteristic that would serve her well when they embarked on the journey of starting their own company.
The birth of Sarah ushered in a new chapter in Mildred's life. She chose to step back from the corporate world, dedicating herself to the roles of mother and wife. Though she occasionally felt like a third wheel in the intellectually intense dynamics between Jack and Sarah, she found fulfillment in her chosen path.
Mildred's personality was a tad more expressive than her husband's or her daughter's. When she disagreed with Jack's decisions, especially concerning Sarah's upbringing, she wasn't afraid to voice her concerns. But when met with resistance, she would often yield, valuing harmony over conflict. Nonetheless, her influence was a gentle but firm grounding force in their family life, providing a balance to Jack's authoritative stance and Sarah's ambition. Mildred loved her life and cherished her role as a loving mother and a supportive wife.</Text>

            <Title>Prepped Scenes</Title>
            <Notes>Plot Summary:
For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his saint of her sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy.
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments.
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz.
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds,  listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally.
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything.
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
`Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls.
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs.
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss.
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire.
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career.
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age.
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number.
A week later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself.
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break.
At the food court., Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car.
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment.
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews.
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart.
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class.
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan.
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss.
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel.
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit.
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him.
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals.
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago.
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person.
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle.
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s close bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan.
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.</Notes>

            <Title>0116 Evan Hopes for Sarah's Return </Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan stayed put, sitting on the stairs where he had just kissed the woman of his dreams. He hoped that she returned to the scene of the kiss. When she didn't show, he returned to the Quad to tell Guido all about what had just happened.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Characters: Evan, Guido
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Locations: The Morrow Plots, the open area outside the entrance to the undergrad library, The Quad. All these locations are on campus at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Tone: Humorous, reflective, introspective, anticipatory, suspenseful
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day

The dialogue I have provided may be used as is or changed at your discretion.
Sequence of Events:
After kissing the woman of his dreams, just to see her bolt into the unknown, Evan saw no point in going into the undergrad library to study. All he could think about was Sarah.
Evan decided to remain near the scene of their first kiss, hoping she would return to retrieve her broken glasses or, even better, return to see him.
This scene has Evan pacing back and forth and anxiously hoping, praying for Sarah to return.
Have Evan walk over to view the Morrow Plots to pass the time, but he never strayed too long for fear he would miss her return.
After an hour with no Sarah to be seen, Evan decided he would fix her glasses and return to the scene of the kiss tomorrow at the same time he first met her.
He hoped that she would have the same plan or that her schedule would be consistent and at the same spot the next day.
Wanting to tell Guido all about his experience with Sarah, Evan walked over to The Quad.
No surprise to Evan; Guido is hitting on two sophomore coeds. When it comes to women, it's a numbers game with Guido. Those two girls were his fifth and sixth attempts of the day.
Evan grabbed Guido by the shirt and pulled him away from the girls. The girls laughed as they continued on their way.
Evan: &quot;I gotta tell you something!&quot;
Guido:  &quot;Hey, Man! Why'd you  do that?&quot; He continued in full bravado. &quot;I had those two in the palm of my hand.&quot;
Of course, Guido did not have the two girls in the palms of his hand. 
Evan: &quot;You did not. Never mind about that. I got something to tell you!&quot;
Guido dons a confused look on his face waiting for Evan to share his news.
Evan: &quot;I just kissed the most beautiful, amazing, wonderful woman in the world!&quot;
A skeptical Guido  replied mildly sarcastically, &quot;Sure you did.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I did, Guido! I am telling you I did.&quot;
Guido: “Where is she? What's her name?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't know. She ran off before I could get her name and number.&quot;
Guido: &quot;You're just fucking with me. You know everyone on campus.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm telling you the truth.&quot; Evan showed Guido Sarah's damaged eyeglasses. &quot;Here's proof. She left these behind. They fell off when we kissed.&quot;
Guido: &quot;That must've been one hell of a kiss!&quot;
Evan: &quot;It was! We kissed before we even spoke one word to each other.&quot; Evan paused and looked at the glasses, &quot;I think I will call her Cinderella. Instead of leaving a glass slipper, she left eyeglasses.&quot;
Guido was surprised. &quot;You kissed a girl seconds after meeting her? That's not like you, bro.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I couldn't help it. The Universe dropped her on my lap, and I had to go for it.&quot;
Guido: &quot;What are you gonna do now?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I am going to fix her glasses and try to find her tomorrow. Do you have an eyeglass repair kit?&quot;
Guido looked at Evan like he was nuts and said sarcastically. &quot;Sure, I got one in my back pocket.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I should be able to find one at the mall. You want to come with?&quot;
Guido: &quot;Nah, I see a little lonely lady over there that looks like she needs a visit from 'The Guido.’&quot;
The scene ends with Evan headed off toward his car to drive to the mall. Try to find a way to keep the reader as vested as Evan was in anticipation of seeing Sarah the next day.</Text>

            <Title>Tamora Pierce</Title>
            <Text>In the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the lives of two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, unfolded with divergent rhythms. 
Evan was a heart-throb, his athletic physique and charisma making him a beloved figure. Raised by his gentle-hearted sister Liz, he had learned to treat everyone with respect, whether they were a high-profile football captain or a humble water boy. But his academic skills didn't mirror his athletic prowess. He held no love for stuffy classrooms, preferring the call of the wild outdoors. But he'd promised Liz he'd aim for a GPA of 3.0 and he intended to keep his word. Hence, he turned his back on the free-spirited games with his friend Guido, immersing himself in study at the undergraduate library.
Sarah, conversely, was an academic luminary, her eyes set firmly on graduating as the class valedictorian. The library was her fortress, where she lost herself in intricate audio seminars and prepared for her teaching assistant role in a Business-101 class. A future CEO of her father's corporation, she had sworn off any romantic entanglements until she had her Master's degree in hand.
Destiny decided to interweave their lives when an engrossed Sarah, oblivious to her surroundings, nearly took a tumble down a wide flight of steps. Evan's quick reflexes saved the day, as he swept her up in a twirling dance move that culminated in a fiery, unexpected kiss. Flustered, Sarah fled, leaving her glasses behind.
Days later, Evan tracked her down, the repaired glasses meant as a charming gesture. In spite of her initial resistance, Sarah found herself yielding to his charm, and they agreed to meet in the food court. There, witnessing Evan's popularity, she doubted herself and the feasibility of their bond, leading her to flee again. Evan, however, wasn't one to be easily discouraged, and following another electrifying kiss, they agreed on a date.
In a twist of events, Sarah found herself relying on Katie Andrews, an earnest student from her class, to help her prepare for the date. With a modernized makeover, Sarah started reassessing her rigid resolution against college romances. If she was to step into this whirlwind, it would be with a well-laid plan, ensuring her academics wouldn't suffer.
Evan agreed to her terms. Ever since their first kiss, he'd been smitten, and now, they officially began their journey as a couple. Sarah slowly allowed herself to explore her dormant romantic side, while Evan improved academically under her guidance. Yet, while they relished the present, the future was a book unopened, Sarah undecided about attending an Ivy League school, and Evan, unbeknownst to her, planning a surprise proposal.
At their graduation party, Evan's proposal caught Sarah off-guard. Though her pragmatic side hesitated, her heart responded with a 'yes.' But her fears of disappointing her father, whom she had misled about the intensity of her relationship with Evan, lingered.
Her father presented her with a choice: follow Evan to Chicago while pursuing her Master's, or adhere to her initial plan. The repercussions of choosing Evan and a life in Chicago would result in the cessation of his financial aid. 
Now, Sarah was caught in a dilemma. She was aware of Evan's loyalty towards his sister and his potential job in Chicago, and she was unwilling to put her needs before his. Thus, she was left with a difficult decision: follow the path she had meticulously planned or give in to the unpredictable call of love. And when the time came, Sarah chose Evan, her heart finally outweighing her calculated judgments.</Text>

7.	He didn't know if he could make it, but he took off at high speed to try and stop her before she fell on the concrete stairs with no railing.
8.	He caught her just in time, but the momentum of her fast pace caused her body to swing around as if they were dancing and he was dipping her.
9.	Her briefcase, purse, and their contents flew in all directions. Her eyeglasses fell to the ground.

13.	They gazed longingly at each other.

Two scenes take place at this location. First is when Katie helps Sarah get ready for her date with Evan. The second is when Sarah returns home from her date with Evan.
Sarah struggles to bond with other college students. However, Katie and Sarah develop a bond at the apartment. Sarah even offers the use of her guest bedroom to Katie when she needs alone time to study.
Description: 
Sarah's apartment is a testament to modern luxury, situated on the top floor of a relatively new six-story student housing complex. The building, less than three years old, exudes a contemporary charm, with its sleek exterior design and high-end amenities.
Her father, ever the generous provider, had secured for her a two-bedroom apartment, one of which she could utilize as an office. However, true to her workaholic nature, Sarah found more comfort working in the same room she slept in. 
Stepping inside the apartment, one is immediately struck by the immaculate cleanliness. The open concept living area is crisply kept, filled with minimalist furniture in subtle hues. Floor-to-ceiling windows line one side of the living room, allowing ample natural light to fill the space while providing breathtaking views of the city below. 
The kitchen area is equally impressive, complete with top-of-the-line stainless steel appliances, a marble countertop, and stylish cabinetry. Despite the well-equipped kitchen, the lack of use indicates Sarah's preference for take-out or on-campus meals over cooking. 
Sarah's bedroom doubles as her workspace, holding a luxurious bed with a stylishly austere frame and an ergonomic desk cluttered with papers, textbooks, and a high-end laptop. The room feels lived in but organized, an oasis of personal space in her otherwise untouched apartment.
The guest bedroom, by contrast, remains pristine and scarcely used. The perfectly made bed, devoid of wrinkles, and the dustless surfaces create an atmosphere of a high-end hotel room, awaiting its first guest. Despite its emptiness, the room is prepared with all the essentials, standing as a silent testament to Sarah's meticulous and organized nature.
Overall, Sarah's apartment reflects her personality – ambitious, detail-oriented, and somewhat reserved, providing a space that's more functional than personal. Despite the apartment's capacity for hosting and socialization, it remains primarily a sanctuary for Sarah, a place of quiet solitude and diligent work.</Text>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

            <Title>0120 Waiting Game</Title>
            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0120 Waiting Game
Characters: Evan, Guido
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Locations: Outside the entrance doors to the undergrad library. The area at and around the spot where Evan and Sarah first kissed.
Tone: The scene starts with Evan hopeful. But as the rain began to drizzle down on him, Evan watched hundreds of people come in and out of the library, none of them being Sarah. With no sight of her, he gradually got sadder and sadder.
Guido came to check on him and successfully got Evan to stop torturing himself at that location and head back to their apartment. 
Guido was also able to instill a bit of hope in Evan.
The scene does a full circle when it comes to Tone. The scene starts with hope,  turns to disappointment, sadness, and then despair before returning to a muted version of hope.
Weather: Cloudy, drizzly
Special Instructions: 
Since there is no dialogue in the first part of this scene, focus on Evan's thoughts and feelings as his emotions roller coaster at first before heading down a steep decline until Guido arrived. I really want the reader to suffer along with Evan. Integrating the increasingly gloomy weather and aligning it with his mood deterioration is essential to help the reader visualize Evans suffering.
Although Guido was not considered a nurturing or compassionate human being, I would like the reader to see he does have a caring side, even if his method of expressing that care is not typical of what others might do.
Even though Guido doesn't really understand why Evan is so distressed, he wanted to be there for his best friend in whatever way he could. 
The dialogue and narratives I have provided may be used as is or changed at your discretion.
Understanding the precise spot where Evan and Sarah had their first kiss is essential. The kiss happened outside in an open, uncovered area on four concrete stairs leading downward from a flat platform. Evan had saved her from a fall, leading to a passionate kiss. The actual spot where they kissed was at least 30 feet from the library entrance.
In the scene, I don't want the reader to think that Evan is stood right in front of the library doors watching people come and go. In his 2-hour, Evan shifts from place to place but never gets too close to the kissing spot or the library entry and exit doors. He is always at least 20 are 30 feet away. I don't want the reader to think Evan is overly pathetic or so desperate that he must stand just 2 feet from the kissing spot or the library entrance doors.
Sequence of Events:
Evan returned to the location where he and Sarah first kissed. He was feeling hopeful, but his hope was diminished a bit, still feeling the disappointment from her not returning to this spot the Friday before.
It was Monday. He figured he had a better chance of seeing her again if he skipped the weekend and returned on a school day. 
His excitement with yo-yo every time he caught a glimpse of blonde hair in his periphery. Every time the door to the undergrad library opened, his heart would skip a beat, thinking it would be her. But she was nowhere to be found.
As time rolled by, the rain rolled in. It started drizzling about half an hour into his wait and continually worsened for another 90 minutes.
Evan had a jacket on but didn't think to bring an umbrella. He did his best to find trees and awnings to stand under to help keep them dry. But he refused to pick any spot that didn't give him a direct view of the library doors and the place where he and Sarah first kissed—his effort to remain dry produced minimal results.
After Evan had been there a couple of hours, Guido came to check on him.
Guido: &quot;No Luck?”
Evan looked dejected. With his head down, he said, &quot;No, I haven't seen her.&quot;
Guido provided his version of consolation, &quot;Sorry, bro. Don't stress it. There are plenty of fish in the sea.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't want to fish in the sea. She's the only one for me.&quot;
Guido: &quot;I don't get you, bro. You got women lined up to be with you, and you're stressing over a girl whose name you don't know? You should adopt my style – no strings attached, no drama.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Yeah, and no hope for love.&quot;
In a way, Guido admired Evan. Guido chuckled. &quot;My friend, ever the hopeless romantic.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm just... I'm just...just…&quot; Evan couldn't find the words to express his sentiment. Frustrated, he said, &quot;I don't know what I am. I just know that I have to see my Cinderella again.&quot;
Guido felt for Evan. Guido joked. &quot;Let's leave the matching glass slipper search for another day. Come on, let's head back to our place. We’ll knock down a few beers and watch baseball. The Cubs actually have a chance for the playoffs this year!&quot;
Evan remained silent but didn't appear ready to go with Guido.
Guido gently persisted. &quot;You'll feel a lot better with a cold brew in your hand and a Cubs victory on the TV. I’ll tell you what, after the game, we’ll try to figure a way to get her name.&quot;
Evan, still silent, was not yet persuaded.
Guido joked, &quot;How hard can it be to find the most beautiful girl on campus?&quot;
Guido's words brought a small smile to Evan's face. 
 Evan: &quot;I suppose you're right. I'll bump into her sooner or later.&quot;
Guido: &quot;Exactly! Let's chill at home, and we’ll scour the Internet when the game ends.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Thanks, dude. I feel better already.&quot;
Nothing more was said as they headed home. The scene ends here. I want the reader to feel Evan's contrasting motions of disappointment that he didn't see Sarah and hope that inevitably he'll find his way to her.&quot;

            <Title>Shear Elegance Hair Salon</Title>
            <Text>Name of the place: Shear Elegance
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign
Type of place: Hair salon
What role does this setting play in the story? 
This venue is the chic salon where Sarah undergoes a contemporary hair transformation. Even though Sarah's hair is already gorgeous, Nicole, the expert hairstylist, opts to infuse it with subtle lowlights, adding depth to her light blonde locks. Simultaneously, she trims a few inches off, maintaining the hair's overall length but refreshing its look.
In the midst of this protracted styling session, the salon evolves into a space of revelation and burgeoning anticipation. The intimate atmosphere, punctuated by the hum of hairdryers and the gentle clatter of hairstyling tools, lends itself to confessions about Sarah's somewhat sparse romantic past. The air practically thrums with a sense of expectation as Sarah contemplates violating her self-imposed dating moratorium and potentially embarking on a relationship with Evan.
Description: 
Tucked away in the heart of a vibrant central Illinois neighborhood lies an unassuming, yet undeniably modern hair salon. Through the large glass facade, the salon's chic and bustling atmosphere beckons to both casual passersby and dedicated customers alike.
Upon crossing the threshold, visitors are met with an airy, open space, replete with the gentle hum of hairdryers, the soft rustle of foil, and the low murmur of friendly conversation. The flooring is a modern marvel, laid out with sleek, polished wooden planks that lend a warm, contemporary touch to the space.
To the right of the entrance, an intimate seating area is neatly arranged. An elegant, tufted couch in a muted gray is flanked by a pair of sleek armchairs. Placed strategically, this area allows Katie to comfortably observe the transformation process from her seat, keeping a watchful eye on Sarah as Nicole works her magic.
Running parallel to the left wall are several state-of-the-art hairstyling stations. Each boasts a large, backlit mirror framed by brushed steel, and a swivel chair upholstered in rich, black leather. Mobile carts filled with an array of high-end hair care products and advanced tools are stationed conveniently next to each chair.
Nicole tends to Sarah at the third station from the entrance, providing a perfect line of sight to Katie from the reflective mirror. The overall lighting is artfully designed to cast an inviting glow over the area, highlighting the natural finishes of the wooden floor and the sophisticated furnishings.
Adding a touch of biophilia, strategically placed potted plants bring a sense of calm and vitality to the salon. The back wall serves as a stylish product display, with lit glass shelves housing an impressive range of premium hair care products and styling tools.
Tucked in the back corner of the salon, a glass partition subtly separates the wash station from the main area. Here, plush, reclining chairs face ceramic sinks, each equipped with modern showerheads, providing a comfortable and relaxing hair-washing experience for clients.
With its soft background music and contemporary aesthetic, this small-town salon rivals its big-city counterparts, promising clients not just a hairstyling appointment, but a luxury experience that caters to their modern tastes.</Text>
