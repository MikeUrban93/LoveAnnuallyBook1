            <Title>0115 Sarah is Frazzled</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah arrives at her class uncharacteristically five minutes late. The typically well-prepared, professional Sarah finds herself frazzled but turns it into a well-received class session.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The classroom was a microcosm of order and structure, juxtaposed with the youthful energy of the students filling it. As the wall clock ticked, the students' faces mirrored their confusion, their eyes flicking to the vacant podium, to the ticking clock, then back to the podium. Where was their punctual teacher's assistant, Sarah Wilkins? 
Then, the door swung open, and there she was, Sarah. Except she was different. Her usually neat hair was let down, her eyes were bare without the usual frame of glasses, and there was a flush to her cheeks that was never there before.
With a silent apology mirrored in her expression, she straightened her outfit, straightened herself, and stepped towards the podium. &quot;I apologize for being late. It will not happen again. Today we will review topics we’ve covered for next week’s exam,” she declared. Her voice, though steady, had an unfamiliar softness to it. 
While Sarah wrote on the board, a student raised his hand. &quot;Ms. Wilkins, we have never discussed that material,&quot; he pointed out. 
Sarah's eyes widened a tad, realization slowly dawning on her. There was a beat of silence before she let out a soft laugh, clearing her throat. “Did you ever have one of those days where something happens that you didn’t expect, and it throws you off your game?” she asked, leaning against her desk in a relaxed pose, the air around her lightening.
Nods and smiles of understanding echoed around the room. It was a rare glimpse of Sarah, the person, not just Sarah, their teacher's assistant.
“Today is one of those days for me,” she admitted, a touch of color staining her cheeks. “Let me tell you a secret about exams. 80% of the questions simply test your memorization. The other 20% are laced with trick questions to gauge how thoroughly you understand the material. Let's focus on the trick questions instead of wasting time on simple memorization. I think this will give everybody a better chance to ace this exam. Is everyone agreeable to that?”
The room erupted in unanimous approval. For once, excitement echoed through the room, as opposed to the usual resignation. The rest of the class flowed easily, a stark difference from their usual sessions. 
As the class emptied, one student, Katie Andrews, approached Sarah. “Ms. Wilkins, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed our class today. Whatever happened, I hope will happen again next week!” 
The corner of Sarah's lips twitched upwards, her heart swelling in her chest. With a nod and a warm smile, she looked at Katie, her thoughts echoing Katie's sentiments. Me too.

            <Title>0125 Evan Finds Sarah at the library</Title>
            <Synopsis>For a second time, Evan returns to the scene of the kiss, looking for Sarah. He decides to look in the library, where he finds Sarah.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah settled back into her regular spot at the undergrad library, the weight of her studies pressing on her mind. She made yet another effort to immerse herself in her work. The pages of her book offered a brief escape, but a familiar sensation made her skin tingle. The very air around her seemed to shift.
Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted him: the mystery man she’d shared that unexpected kiss with. Their eyes met, and a mix of anxiety and excitement surged within her. She tried to hide behind her book, but her attempt was feeble at best. 
His presence drew nearer until she could no longer pretend not to notice. She took a deep breath and peeked at him from behind her book. Those eyes, so intense and yet playful, met hers. The world seemed to pause for a split second.
He held out a pair of glasses—the ones she thought she’d never see again. They were fixed. As she nodded her permission, her heart raced, and she closed her eyes, feeling the gentle touch of his fingers as he replaced her glasses with the repaired pair. She could feel the warmth of his hands, even though they barely brushed against her skin.
His voice broke the silence. “Ah, much better. Not that there’s anything wrong with the glasses you were wearing, but I like these a lot better. I hope I did a good job fixing them?”
Trying to maintain her composure, she replied, “Yes, you did. Thank you. How much do I owe you?”
“You don’t owe me anything! But you can join me for a snack at the food court. We could call it an energy exchange?” he countered, his tone playful.
Sarah hesitated, torn between her responsibilities and the undeniable pull she felt towards him. “I have studying to do.”
“Well, I have to study too!” Evan declared. 
His persistence was both vexing and endearing. When he vanished momentarily only to return to the seat across from her and read a book upside down, she couldn’t help but be amused. 
“Do you always read your books upside down?” Sarah queried, her eyebrow hitched up in amusement.
With an exaggerated gasp, Evan flipped the book, a playful grin dancing on his lips. “Ah, now this book makes more sense!”
Chuckles bubbled up from Sarah’s throat as she glimpsed the title, Female Poets of the 19th Century. “Really? You don’t look like a poetry major to me.”
With a swift nod and a spark in his eyes, Evan replied, “I love the female poets of the 19th century.”
Arching her brow in a silent challenge, Sarah shot back, “Can you even name one?”
Not missing a beat, Evan exclaimed, “Emily Dickinson!”
A smirk curled Sarah’s lips as she teased, “Do you really know that, or is she the only female poet you’ve heard of?”
Evan leaned back, a chuckle escaping him. “I am an expert on female poetry from the 19th century!”
A soft laugh from Sarah echoed around them. “You are, are you? Okay then, what is your favorite poem?” 
Before he could glance down at his safety net, Sarah commanded, “Close the book. Okay, now tell me your favorite poem.”
A whimsical story spilled from Evan’s lips, an almost poetic cadence to his voice. “Well, I can’t remember who wrote it, but I remember the name. It’s called The Kiss. It’s a poem about this beautiful coed saved from certain death by a valiant young man. They have this most amazing kiss. But then she disappears like Cinderella at midnight. He ultimately finds her, and she futilely attempts to resist his charming ways.”
An intrigued smile formed on Sarah’s face. “Hmm, interesting. So how does the poem end?” 
Evan replied with a confident air, “Happily ever after, of course!”
Evan’s charm weakened her resolve as she attempted to refocus on her study material. His antics continued. He opened the book again and altered his facial expression and voice to mimic a distinguished professor.
He pretended to critique a poem. “Very nice. Excellent poetic structure. Great use of hyperbole.”
She couldn’t suppress her laughter. His comic faux critique of a poem was the last straw. “You are going to keep annoying me until I agree to go to the food court, aren’t you?”
Evan countered, his eyes wide in mock surprise, “Annoying? I was shooting for charming!”
Sarah surrendered to a full-blown laugh. “Okay, fine, annoyingly charming.”
They bantered back and forth. His sincerity shone through when he said, “I’ll stop bothering you if you want. But I say let’s get to know each other. Unless I imagined it, that kiss was wonderful for you, too. All I’m asking for is fifteen minutes. That’s it, just fifteen minutes of your time! What do you say?”
She sighed, admitting defeat—not to him, but to the chemistry between them. “Alright, fifteen minutes it is!” 
As she gathered her things, he gracefully gestured for her to lead the way. As they approached the exit, Evan quickly moved to her side with a smooth and courteous maneuver, reaching the door just ahead of her. With a kind smile, he held it open, allowing her to pass through first. The door closed behind them, marking the beginning of an unexpected journey, filled with potential and promise.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Evan sees Sarah, a woman he has never met, headed for disaster in the form of concrete steps. He rushes to save her from a dangerous fall, and in the process, they share a kiss.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah bolted from the library, earbuds blaring, eyes wide with the impending doom of lateness. The library steps loomed ahead, a sudden drop just waiting for the unwary, and she was just the kind of unwary the steps had in mind.
From the corner of her eye, she noticed Evan. He was just another student, someone she hadn't met before. But he had spotted her imminent tumble, her focus diverted to the chaotic thoughts swirling in her mind.
“Hey, lady in the skirt suit!&quot; he shouted, loud enough to catch everyone's attention except the lady in the skirt suit.
His legs propelled him forward, closing the gap between them with an urgency that matched her own. His arms enveloped her just as her foot missed the first step, the momentum of her hurried escape carrying them in a wild twirl. Her briefcase and purse took flight, flinging their contents everywhere. Her glasses escaped from her face, spiraling to the ground.
Her hair fell in a cascade of wavy blonde hair as the barrette that held it surrendered to the force of their twirl. As she leaned back into him, almost parallel to the ground, Evan could see that she was not a professor as he had initially thought, but a student like himself.
Their eyes locked, a silent conversation passing between them. &quot;I feel like I should kiss you,&quot; Evan said, his words floating in the space between them. Sarah's eyes sparkled with a mix of amusement and surprise, and she responded, &quot;I’m not going to stop you.&quot;
Their lips met in a passionate kiss that seemed to suspend time, making the world outside their embrace fade away. After the kiss, Evan helped her to her feet, a newfound softness in his gaze.
Suddenly, reality came rushing back to her, and she remembered her lateness. She quickly gathered her scattered belongings with Evan's help. 
&quot;What's your name?&quot; he asked. 
Flustered, she replied, &quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot;
&quot;That's a strange name,&quot; he joked, but the humor was lost on her. She was too caught up in her rush, her mind a whirlwind of confusion.
She dashed away, unknowingly leaving her broken glasses behind. Evan picked them up and called after her, but she was already disappearing into the distance. Evan was left standing there, a lighthearted grin on his face and her glasses in his hand, looking forward to the future encounter that their unexpected meeting promised.

Title: Sarah Prepares Her Apartment for Evan's Arrival
Summary:
Sarah busily prepares for Evan's inaugural visit to her apartment, filled with anticipation. She devises an unexpected surprise to kickstart their date, adding an extra layer of excitement to their blossoming relationship. Her heart races as the time of his arrival nears, and she hopes the surprise will bring them closer.
Setting:
Location: Sarah's apartment
Time: 6:30 PM on Friday Night following the Sunday softball game.
Weather/Environment: Rain and Thunderstorms
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Sarah
Secondary Characters: None
Character Emotional State:
Sarah: Relaxed, optimistic, hopeful, looking forward to the night ahead
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)
Dialogue Focus: None
Use of Internal Dialogue: Heavy
Plot/Action:
Beginning: The scene starts with Sarah preparing her apartment for Evan's visit. In the beginning, we want to set the stage. We catch the reader up on Sarah's transformation from her stressful post-game party on Sunday to her more relaxed mood a few days later on Friday night.
Middle: Most of the scene will be Sarah preparing the table and herself for Evan’s arrival and mentally replaying her conversation with Katie the day after the post-party drama.
Katie had talked her (metaphorically speaking) down from the edge of the cliff. She convinced Sarah that she had overreacted to the post-game party. Katie told her it was just a typical party at a pub. That's no reason to question her decision about Evan or to let it overwhelm her. She was making a mountain out of a molehill.
Sarah realized the wisdom of Katie's words. In fact, she had shared similar advice with girls in her honor classes that fell apart in a similar situation. 
It took her a couple of days to find amusement in the high drama she injected into such a typical college experience.
She had no illusion that she would ever bond with Evan's group of friends, but she would never turn it into such a crisis.
She hadn't seen Evan since she dropped him off after the party. After losing two days of studies, she quickly got caught up and felt good about Evan’s visit. This scene should reflect her change in mood from the last scene after the party.
Tonight is what she had in mind when she decided to enter a relationship with Evan. Just him and her enjoying each other's company, alone. When she's alone with Evan, she feels she can let go and explore this emotional side of her.
In this scene, she will put study supplies and educational materials on the dining room table. However, we won't reveal to the reader why she was doing that until the next scene. We want to leave the reader curious why she is setting up academic materials for a Friday night date.
End: A simple knock on the door end the scene. It will be Evan. The next scene will start with Sarah letting Evan in.
Objectives/Goals:
After such an intense Sunday post-game party scene, we will give the reader a rest. This scene has no external dialogue because Sarah is its only character. But through her actions, thoughts, and inner dialogue, we find out that, with the help of her friend Katie, she recovered from her dramatic experience at Sunday's party.
Now she's relaxed, comfortable, and looking forward to an evening at her apartment with Evan.
Props/Items:
Dining room table
Academic material
Local pizzeria menus. The purpose of the pizzeria menus is so Sarah can order in from Evan's favorite pizzeria. This was Katie's idea. Sarah always cooks for one. She prepares her lean, simple meals at the beginning of the week, then heats them up for lunch and dinner as the week progresses. 
Not knowing what Evan would like, Katie just stated the obvious. All college men are addicted to pizza—especially one from Chicago. Trusting Katie's knowledge, she collected menus from the nearby pizzerias. Include this in the scene.
Special Instructions/Notes:
Since Sarah's apartment has already been fully described in a previous scene, conservative with the amount of narrative regarding the setting.
Focus more on the dining room table. That has yet to be described. It will be stylish and sizable because Sarah uses it to spread out during her study. That was her primary reason for buying a large table when it was just her.
Have Sarah do a last-minute check for makeup and clothing in the mirror before she hears a knock on the door.
You should mention what Sarah is wearing: jeans, a casual pullover T-shirt, and slip-on shoes. Let the reader know that Sarah likes her new look and the comfort of her clothes.
Tell the reader that Evan and Sarah's communication has been exclusively through texts since the party. Sarah was careful to take time before replying to Evan's texts. As much as she wanted to respond the split second after he texted her, and as much as she wanted to talk to him on the phone and see him in person, it was necessary for her to keep things slow so that she could catch up on her academic studies and her nonprofit commitments. This worked, and Sarah was all caught up, feeling free and untethered for the evening.
Note: Katie is mentioned in the scene, but she is not present. All references to Katie are related to a conversation Sarah remembered from early in the week.

            <Title>Nicholas Sparks</Title>
            <Text>Set amidst the beautiful backdrop of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the narrative introduces Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, two distinct souls on the verge of destiny. As their senior year begins, life proceeds as it always has. They are strangers, moving in different circles, unaware that fate will soon interweave their stories.
Evan, blessed with striking good looks and a compelling aura, is the center of attention on campus. Yet, his popularity doesn’t stem from vanity, but rather a genuine, likable personality that effortlessly attracts others, a quality cultivated by his kind-hearted sister, Liz. His academic prowess, however, doesn’t quite match his social skills. Not due to a lack of capability, but a preference for the liberating outdoors over confined classrooms. Despite this, he is committed to achieving a 3.0 GPA, a promise made to Liz that he intends to keep. Thus, he reluctantly trades time spent in nature for studying, hoping to uphold his promise.
Sarah, conversely, embodies academic excellence. A prospective business major and the heart of the university library, she is determined to graduate top of her class. Lost in an audio seminar one day, she abruptly realizes she is about to be late for a class she teaches. In her hurry to exit the library, she remains oblivious to the descending staircase just outside the door.
Noticing Sarah’s impending fall, Evan leaps into action. His warnings go unheard due to her earbuds, leaving him no choice but to dart toward her, intercepting her just in time. The ensuing spontaneous kiss shared in the aftermath of this dramatic event leaves an indelible mark on their hearts, igniting a flame they never knew existed.
Despite this unexpected turn of events, Sarah struggles to balance her newfound emotions with her ambitious plans to succeed her father in their family business. Having made a promise to both herself and her father to steer clear of romantic distractions until after her graduation, she finds herself in a predicament.
Even so, Evan's charm and the chemistry between them proves too strong to resist. When he returns her forgotten glasses, Sarah finally succumbs to his persistence, agreeing to a date. Their relationship blossoms, albeit with Sarah setting clear expectations to ensure her academic aspirations remain undeterred. Evan, captivated by Sarah, readily agrees to these conditions.
Their shared senior year becomes a transformative journey. Sarah discovers a new side of her personality as she learns to navigate social engagements, while Evan, with Sarah's guidance, sees a marked improvement in his academics. But as graduation nears, uncertainty begins to cloud Sarah's mind.
Unknown to Sarah, Evan is planning a proposal. During their graduation party, in the presence of their friends and a surprise appearance from her parents, Evan proposes. Caught off guard, Sarah accepts, much to her parents' surprise as she had previously downplayed the intensity of their relationship.
Her father, a man of rationality and fairness, offers her a choice - to pursue a future with Evan in Chicago without his financial support, or to stick to her initial plan of achieving her Masters and joining him in Seattle. Faced with this dilemma, Sarah must decide between her long-standing ambitions and her heart's yearning for Evan.
In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, this tale of love and self-discovery explores the poignant moments of life-changing decisions. Despite the odds, it is Sarah's heart that prevails, choosing a future with Evan in Chicago over her original academic plan. This is a testament to the power of love and its ability to reshape lives, a familiar theme in Sparks' emotional narratives.</Text>
            <Notes>[This scene is written in a style reminiscent of Nicholas Sparks, with a primary focus on the character's internal emotional turmoil, vivid depictions of the surroundings, and symbolism-laden gestures.]</Notes>

            <Title>0164 Evan Gives Sarah a Pendant</Title>
            <Synopsis>After dinner, Evan gives Sarah a customized, inexpensive pendant before leaving in her car. The pendant is more of a sentimental piece of jewelry meant to commemorate the unique way statement. Although Sarah is accustomed to wearing expensive jewelry, she loves the pendant Evan had made for her.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The cool early fall night embraced them as they stepped out of the Thai Garden Restaurant, their hearts still fluttering from the enchanting evening they had shared. Hand in hand, Evan guided Sarah towards her car, the silent connection between them saying more than words ever could. Each step they took was filled with the lingering excitement of their first date, and neither of them felt the need to break the silence.
Once they reached Sarah's car, she turned around and leaned against the driver's side door, facing Evan. He looked into her eyes, the depths of his gaze reflecting the whirlwind of emotions he felt in that moment. The air was charged with an electrifying blend of desire and sentiment.
Evan leaned in, his lips finding hers in a kiss that was both familiar and new. The kiss started tenderly, an exploration of their feelings before it deepened into a passionate embrace. It was a moment of surrender, a release of the tension that had been building throughout the evening. The energy between them shifted dramatically, the formality of their earlier conversation giving way to the raw intensity of their emotions.
As their lips finally parted, Sarah looked into Evan's eyes, her heart racing. She spoke, her voice a mixture of vulnerability and honesty. &quot;I love the way I feel when you kiss me, but it scares me. You have this power over me. It’s intoxicating. I apologize for my business-like approach. I’ve never had a real romantic relationship before, and I’m struggling with the fear of losing control.&quot;
Evan's gaze held hers, his expression soft and understanding. &quot;Never apologize for being who you are. You have the same power over me. It doesn’t scare me, though. It feels like I have been waiting for you. I’ve never felt this way about anybody before. I understand this is unfamiliar territory for you. I promise I won’t pressure you to do anything before you’re ready.&quot;
A playful smile crossed Sarah's lips. &quot;I sense you won’t have to wait too long.&quot;
Evan's eyes lit up with hope. &quot;I like the sound of that! I don’t suppose you have time to hang out more tonight?&quot;
Sarah shook her head, a hint of regret in her expression. &quot;Not tonight. My friend Katie is waiting for me back at my apartment. I will be there on Sunday to see your game.&quot;
Seeing Sarah's commitment to attending his game brought a genuine smile to Evan's face. &quot;I'm looking forward to it.&quot;
Evan's next words took Sarah by surprise as he pulled out a box from his pocket. Inside the box lay a delicate silver pendant attached to a silver chain. The pendant was a tiny set of eyeglasses, a symbol that held a deep significance for both of them.
&quot;May I put this on you, my Cinderella?&quot; Evan's voice held a touch of playfulness, and Sarah turned around to allow him to fasten the necklace around her neck. As she turned back to face him, she held the pendant in her hand, examining it closely.
Evan could see the curiosity and confusion in Sarah's eyes, prompting him to share the story behind the necklace. &quot;You know how I call you my Cinderella because you’re always running away from me?&quot;
Sarah nodded, her lips curling into a fond smile.
Evan continued, his voice gentle and sentimental. &quot;I wanted to get you something for our date tonight, and I wanted it to be unique. While shopping, I ran across this glass case with a bunch of small Cinderella-type glass slippers and shoes. It turns out people collect these things. They gave me the idea of a necklace with an eyeglass pendant inspired by the glasses you left behind while making your escape.&quot;
Sarah's smile deepened, and she chuckled softly at Evan's playful comment.
&quot;I couldn’t find any necklaces like that,&quot; Evan continued, his voice filled with warmth. &quot;I shopped at all the jewelry stores I could find. But I couldn’t find anything that would work. I even tried the jewelry sections at the department stores, nothing. I was about to give up when I passed by this antique store. And what do you know, the universe plopped an antique doll with the perfect size glasses right in the window for me to see.&quot;
Evan's voice carried a mix of amazement and excitement as he recounted his journey to find the pendant. &quot;I bought the doll and took the glasses to a jeweler to have the glasses attached to a chain. The jeweler suggested dipping it in silver so that it would last forever. Forever sounded good to me, so I had him do that. I meant it to commemorate our first kiss. Whenever you wear it, I want you to remember that magical moment.&quot;
Tears welled up in Sarah's eyes, her heart deeply touched by Evan's thoughtful gesture. She looked at the pendant, now hanging around her neck, and felt a rush of emotions she hadn't anticipated.
&quot;Thank you, Evan,&quot; she managed to say, her voice filled with genuine gratitude. &quot;That’s so romantic and so sweet. I can’t believe I’m crying. I haven’t cried since I was a child.&quot;
Evan pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her in a comforting hug. &quot;Does that mean you like it?&quot;
Sarah looked up at him, her eyes glistening with tears. &quot;I love it! It’s the most wonderful, beautiful, stupendous gift I’ve ever received from anybody. I can’t believe I’m going to ask this, but if you kept the doll, may I have it?&quot;
Evan chuckled softly, his fingers brushing away the tears that had escaped down her cheeks. &quot;I will bring it on Sunday.&quot;
Sarah's smile was radiant as she expressed her gratitude once again. The desire to have the doll surprised even her, but in that moment, she knew it held a special place in her heart.
As the night drew to a close, Sarah's sense of reluctance mingled with the excitement of what lay ahead. &quot;I don’t want this night to end, but I need to get home. My friend is waiting, and I have an early class tomorrow.&quot;
Evan nodded, his gaze holding hers. &quot;No worries. Can I ask you for one more thing, maybe two?&quot;
A playful glint danced in Sarah's eyes. &quot;You sure can.&quot;
Evan's voice was light, filled with a touch of humor. &quot;Can I get your last name? Maybe a phone number or an email?&quot; He smirked, a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.
Sarah burst into laughter, her eyes sparkling with amusement. &quot;Of course, you can.&quot; She handed him a business card, encouraging him to send his information to her.
Before they parted ways, they shared one more long, passionate kiss, a sweet promise of what was to come. As they finally pulled away, the echo of their shared emotions lingered in the cool night air, a silent promise of the journey their hearts were embarking upon.

            <Title>0130 Evan and Sarah Food Court Date</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan convinces Sarah to break from her studies and join him at the food court for a snack. Panicked, she runs out on Evan, but he catches up to her outside.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan had been strategic, leading Sarah on a route that unavoidably passed the spot of their first kiss. He paused there, gazing at her with an intensity that made her heart thump against her ribs. &quot;I’ve been waiting to kiss you again since the first moment I saw you today,” he confessed, his voice rough.
Gently, Evan's fingers curled around hers, the sensation setting a tremor of awareness coursing through her. &quot;Come with me,&quot; he suggested, his voice as soft and alluring as the hold he had on her hand.
Sarah recoiled slightly, confusion flickering in her eyes. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked, her tone wavering between uncertainty and curiosity.
“I’m holding your hand.” His reply was casual, as though it were the most natural thing in the world. Anticipating her need for an explanation, he added, “I figured it was okay. Everything less than that is allowed once you’ve gone to a certain point with someone. Since we already kissed twice, holding hands seems a given.”
Despite the knots of anxiety tying her stomach into pretzel-like twists, Sarah discovered she couldn't quite fight off the lure of Evan’s infectious confidence. His logic was faultless, and the thought occurred to her—That does make sense!—adding an almost humorous slant to her internal dilemma. As they meandered through the bustling food court, immersed in the vibrant chatter that encapsulated the university's social scene, she felt her hand comfortably nestle into his. 
The food court was a vibrant hub of activity. Students moved to and fro, their laughter and discussions creating an ambient hum that echoed around the vast space. The air was rich with the tantalizing scent of food from different cultures, and the murals that adorned the walls injected a youthful energy into the surroundings. Amid the chaos and noise, Sarah and Evan stood out, their hands interlocked in a silent promise of an unforeseen journey.
But with every passing minute, Sarah’s unease grew. Everywhere they went, students gave Evan friendly nods, simple smiles, or a casual wave of the wrist. The knowing looks and insinuating whispers from the predominantly female crowd were disconcerting. She wondered if she'd become an intruder in his world. She began to question why he had chosen her of all people.
Prompted by Evan, they found themselves seated at a table, the noise and activity of the food court reduced to a dull hum in the background. Evan returned shortly with bottles of water and fruit cups, a simple and light snack as per Sarah’s request.
The exchange began with the basics: their names and simple introductions. But when Evan asked her to share something more about herself, a wave of awkwardness washed over Sarah. She was so accustomed to the structure of professional-like interactions, the conversational ebb and flow of academic dialogues, that this request for personal detail felt foreign, disarming.
Unconsciously, she slipped into autopilot mode. The socially naive part of her receded, replaced by the poised, articulate woman who had faced countless academic panels and summer internship interviews. With the clinical precision of a resume, she began to list her accomplishments, her words spilling out in an educated, polished tumble of phrases that felt jarringly out of place in the casual environment.
Across the table, Evan watched her, his eyes sparkling with a quiet warmth. He saw her struggle, her resort to what was comfortable and familiar. Instead of interrupting or correcting her, he chose to sit back, a gentle smile playing on his lips. He was attentive, listening to each word with interest, and his expression was one of sheer fascination. There was an undeniable charm in her earnest recital, in the passionate way she recounted her academic accomplishments, in her slight discomfort navigating the unfamiliar waters of personal conversation. In the subtle crinkle of his eyes, the softening of his gaze, anyone looking would see the deepening of Evan’s affection for Sarah, an adoration unphased by her unconventional response.
The silence that hung between them after Sarah finished speaking was palpable, carrying the weight of her misstep. But within Evan's patient gaze, there was no judgment—only an eagerness to know more, to delve deeper into the complex enigma that was Sarah.
As the minutes passed, Sarah could feel the weight of awkwardness settle over them. The thrill of their earlier encounter was rapidly giving way to her self-doubt and anxiety. Overwhelmed, Sarah fled the food court, her flight triggered by her own insecurities, fear, and uncertainty</Text>

            <Title>0135 Gudio Hears the Big News</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah's resistance weakens further as she agrees to go on a date with Evan later in the week.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan's foot tapped impatiently against the floor as he glanced at the clock. They were late for work, and Guido was taking forever in the bathroom, primping and preening as if it were a special occasion. Evan's anxiety level was ratcheting up; he needed to be at the gym by six o'clock for a client session, and time was slipping away. But more than that, he was desperate to share his news with Guido, his best friend.
&quot;Come on, Guido!&quot; Evan called out, knowing that his plea would probably go ignored. Guido's fixation with his appearance was well-known, especially now that there was a new female personal trainer at the gym he wanted to impress.
Finally, Guido emerged from the bathroom, every strand of his hair gelled perfectly into place. &quot;Relax, bro,&quot; he said, a grin spreading across his face. &quot;We've got plenty of time.&quot;
&quot;You've got plenty of time,&quot; Evan corrected, grabbing his keys. &quot;I've got a client session at six, and I need to talk to you about Sarah.&quot;
Guido's eyes widened. &quot;Sarah? What's the big news, bro?&quot;
&quot;Not here,&quot; Evan said, urging Guido towards the door. &quot;In the car.&quot;
Guido's old Honda Civic roared to life, and as they pulled out of the apartment complex, Evan began to relive his experience with Sarah, detailing every moment of their time together. Guido listened, a bemused expression on his face, concern growing as he realized how infatuated Evan was with this girl.
&quot;Dude, you're obsessed,&quot; Guido finally interrupted. &quot;I've never seen you like this.&quot;
Evan's face flushed. &quot;I need your help, Guido. How can I make the date special? What should I get her?&quot;
Guido looked at Evan like he'd lost his mind. &quot;How would I know what's special? Special to me is spending the night.&quot; He rattled off a list of common gifts: candy, flowers, wine, and lingerie.
Evan shot down each suggestion, claiming they were either cliché or inappropriate for a first date. Guido's patience wore thin, irritation creeping into his voice. &quot;I don't know, dude, you're asking the wrong guy. Get your act together, or she's gonna ditch you ten minutes into the date. You better play cool like 'The Guido.'&quot;
Evan's face fell, but he knew Guido had a point. He was acting overly enthusiastic, and he needed to reel it in.
&quot;Look, bro,&quot; Guido continued, his voice softening. &quot;I'm glad you got a date with this girl. But rumor is, she's high-class. You better get your act together before Thursday.&quot;
&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot; Evan asked, genuinely curious.
&quot;She wants a cool, sophisticated dude. If you want to get her something special, think Gucci purse, expensive shoes, jewelry–&quot;
&quot;That's it! You're a genius, dude,&quot; Evan interrupted, his face lighting up with inspiration.
Guido grinned, pleased with himself. &quot;What are you gonna get her?&quot;
They pulled into the gym parking lot, and as they headed toward the entrance, Evan replied, &quot;I’m not sure. I'll go to the mall tomorrow and look for inspiration.&quot;
The two friends entered the gym, Guido's flashy appearance drawing rolled-eyes, and Evan's mind abuzz with possibilities.

Character Description:
Liz Vaughn, 23, embodies wisdom, compassion, and nurturing qualities that have defined her relationships, particularly with her younger brother, Evan. Born and raised in Glenview, Illinois, she carries a strong sense of family and moral integrity. Her brown eyes radiate kindness, and her medium-long, wavy brown hair adds to her approachable demeanor.
Her clothing choices reflect her conservative nature, favoring business casual in her professional life and dresses for special occasions. Liz has a tendency to be the mentor and mother figure in her relationships, always putting others' needs first. She's a lover of wine and coffee and enjoys socializing with family and friends but dislikes rudeness, manipulation, and arrogance.
Her personality aligns with the Sage archetype, and her Myers-Briggs type is INFP. Strengths like being helpful, caring, compassionate, loving, reliable, and nurturing define her character, but these strengths also manifest as her weaknesses, as she sometimes prioritizes others to her own detriment.
In her relationships, Liz is a devoted sister to Evan and a loving partner to Joe, her boyfriend who becomes her husband in the future. Her dream is simple yet profound: to marry, buy a house, have children, and live a happy and fulfilled life. Her role in Evan's life, as a sister, mentor, and surrogate mother, has been instrumental in shaping him into the man he becomes.
Liz's strong moral compass and her belief in the importance of family form the foundation of her character. Her aspirational goal of starting a family mirrors her love for those around her. Her character symbolizes the enduring bonds of family, the transformative power of love, and the resilience of a young woman who has matured beyond her years, providing guidance and support to those she loves. Her presence, though small in the novel's plot, has a profound and lasting impact on Evan's life.

Name of the place: Penthouse Suite at Champaign Hotel
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign
Type of place: Hotel suite
What role does this setting play in the story?
The Penthouse Suite in the Champaign Hotel serves as the quiet sanctuary where Sarah and her parents retreat after the exuberance of the graduation party and Evan's surprise proposal. This private space, away from the noise and crowd of the party, provides the perfect backdrop for a family discussion about Sarah's future.

The tasteful decor features a neutral palette, with contrasting elements of dark wood furniture and plush, cream-colored upholstery. A large, comfortable sectional sofa occupies one corner of the room, paired with a glass coffee table and a couple of elegant armchairs, providing a comfortable setting for the family discussion.
Off to one side, a small dining area is neatly set up, complete with a modern dining table and six chairs. Beyond the dining area, a well-equipped kitchenette is visible, complete with high-end appliances and marble countertops. 
The bedroom, accessible via a short corridor, is a picture of cozy luxury. A king-size bed, covered with crisp white linens and fluffy pillows, invites rest and relaxation. Adjacent to the bed, a full-length window provides breathtaking views of the city's nightscape.
The suite exudes an air of serene sophistication, amplified by the tastefully selected artwork that adorns the walls. The entire atmosphere of the suite speaks of privacy and comfort, serving as the ideal location for an important family discussion about Sarah's future after a surprising and eventful evening.

            <Text>Create/Replace this location profile.
Location Profile:
Name of the place: Undergrad Library, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
Nickname: Undergrad Library. For this novel never use the acronym UGL.
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign/Urbana
Type of place: Library
What role does this setting play in the story? 
Two scenes take place at this location. At the beginning of the story, this is where Sarah was when she realizes she was late for the class she was supposed to teach in her role as a teacher's assistant.
It plays a vital role because this is where Evan is headed to study extra to maintain a 3.0 GPA. He is on his way to the library, and she is rushing out. Shortly after she leaves the library, Evan saves her from a severe fall, and they kiss.
The second scene at this location is when Evan desperately wants to see the girl he kissed but has little information about. He gets the idea to check inside the library since that's where she came from on the day of the kiss. He finds her there and charms a reluctant Sarah into joining him at the food court.
Are there any unique or notable aspects of the setting? 
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's Undergraduate Library (UGL) is built underground due to a local ordinance at the time of its construction, in the late 1960s. This regulation stipulated that no structure could be erected that would cast a shadow on the Morrow Plots, an important agricultural research field located on campus.
The Morrow Plots were established in 1876 and are the oldest such experimental fields in the United States and the third oldest in the world. They have been used to develop new and improved methods of farming and to study the long-term impacts of various farming techniques on soil composition and crop yields.
To respect this historical site and adhere to the ordinance, the university decided to construct the Undergraduate Library underground, which allowed it to provide a large, modern library facility without casting a shadow on the Morrow Plots.
The UGL was specifically designed to cater to the needs of undergraduate students, with a wide array of resources and study spaces, and it quickly became a hub for student learning and collaboration. Its subterranean construction adds a unique touch to its importance as an academic institution
Notes: 
The undergraduate library was a flurry of activity and bright, relentless fluorescent lighting. Instead of a quiet sanctuary, it was a hub of engagement, a hive buzzing with the energy of youthful minds. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a stark, almost clinical glow over the rows of tables and chairs, making the room feel less like a typical library and more like a vibrant community center.
Groups of students huddled together at the tables, doing their best to keep their voices down but often failing in those efforts, as evidenced by scolded looks from others trying to study.
In corners and along the aisles between bookshelves, there were pockets of flirtation. Amidst the academic pursuit, the library also served as a social arena, a meeting point for like-minded individuals who could connect over shared study materials and the occasional whispered joke. A glance stolen across the study table, a shy smile in response to a witty remark, the quiet exchange of notes – these were as common in the library as textbooks and highlighters.
It was more than a library; it was a microcosm of college life, a blend of hard work, cooperation, and the undercurrent of budding romance. Students came for the books but stayed for the energy and camaraderie that hummed through the bright, lively room.
</Text>
            <Notes>You have previously given me a description of what the undergrad library environment would've been like. Please rewrite the description of that location using the following information:

The undergrad library's lighting was always very bright–fluorescent. That made it feel less calm than your description. Also, there was always a group or two of students studying together, talking in regular voices rather than hushed tones. Finally, it was common for people to go to the library to flirt with their crushes. Not sure how you capture that, though.</Notes>

Title: Evan's First Luxury Hotel Room
Summary:
After professing his love to Sarah and sharing a sensual goodnight kiss, Evan is filled with joy. Although Sarah doesn't voice her love, Evan sees it in her eyes and feels it in her kiss. Entering his luxurious hotel room for the first time, he's thrilled by the opulence, feeling that everything in his world is exactly as it should be. As he settles in, an envelope slipped under his door catches his eye. Inside, he finds a key card to Sarah's hotel room and a handwritten note saying &quot;I'm ready,&quot; leaving him with a sense of anticipation and excitement.
Leading Context:
In the preceding scenes, Evan declared his love to Sarah, leaving her in a state of blissful contemplation with a sensual goodnight kiss. Afterward, he retired to his hotel room, his mind swirling with emotions. Meanwhile, Sarah, wrapped in euphoria, confided in a trusted hotel staff member, asking her to slip an envelope under Evan's door. The contents of the envelope remained a mystery, a secret yet to unfold. While the beginning and middle of this scene did not reveal the envelope's delivery, the end finally unveiled its contents and shed light on the hidden message within.
Setting:
Location: Evan's Luxury Suite at the Grandeur Hotel. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the contrasting scenes of a bustling Saturday night in downtown Chicago unfolded. To the left, tall skyscrapers reached towards the sky, their windows aglow, and the streets beneath alive with the vibrant pulse of city life. To the right, the calm darkness of Lake Michigan provided a serene counterpoint, its vast waters reflecting the distant city lights in a dance of shadow and illumination.
Weather/Environment: A clear night.
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Evan
Secondary Characters: The hotel staff member, Nina, who was trusted by Sarah to slip an envelope underneath Evan's door.
Character Emotional State:
Evan: Floating on cloud nine about his love for Sarah. Giddy as a schoolboy about his cool luxury suite.
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)
Dialogue Focus: Minimal
Use of Internal Dialogue: Heavy
Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
[ Begin the scene with Evan opening the door to his luxury room suite. Evan grew up of modest means, and his eyes widened upon seeing such an extravagant suite. His eyes lit up like a child entering Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory. ]
[ Utilizing deep POV and internal dialogue, describe the room through Evan's eyes. ]
Evan looked out the window at the city lights.
[ Provide a vivid description of Evan's view out the window. ]
Evan looked at the mini-fridge, filled with snacks, sodas, and small bottles of liquor. Sarah had left a sticky note on the refrigerator door, &quot;Evan, help yourself. - Sarah&quot;.
[ Evan giggled with delight upon seeing the contents of the mini-fridge, and the notes Sarah had left. ]
Middle: 
Evan decided to take a shower before he went to bed. Upon entering the shower he was spellbound by the enormity of the room. He mentally noted that it was nearly the size of his whole bedroom. He mentally exaggerated that the shower was the size of a football field. 
[ Describe in deep POV Evan's thoughts while in the shower. Like Sarah in her bath, Evan relived the wonderful evening that had just taken place. For the first time, he told a woman that he loved her. He was simultaneously on cloud nine and giddy as a schoolboy. We want the reader to understand Evan's emotional status while in the shower. ]
Evan got out of the shower, towel-dried his hair, and used that towel to wrap around his waist. 
[ Note: this book will primarily appeal to women. Consider describing Evan's sculpted, athletic body as he stands in front of the mirror brushing his teeth and combing his hair. ]
After Evan was done in the bathroom, he looked at the king-size bed with delight. In his apartment bedroom, there's only room enough for a small twin-size bed.
Evan turned to face the king-size bed, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. In a single, fluid motion, he leaped into the air, his legs and buttocks landing simultaneously on the plush mattress. The springs creaked in response as he settled back, his back nestling comfortably against the thick, inviting pillows. With a contented smile, he crossed his right leg over his left and placed his left hand casually behind his head.
Reaching for the TV remote with his right hand, he turned on the television. It flickered to life as he pressed the power button, his grin widening at the thought of a relaxing evening ahead. The carefree gesture and the soft glow of the TV screen encapsulated the joy and excitement that filled him. He was truly enjoying this moment, basking in the luxury and comfort of his surroundings.
End: 
As Evan was flipping through channels looking for something to watch, he heard a tapping on his door, and he heard the sound of paper gliding on the hotel's laminated wood floors. 
He got up from the bed and saw an envelope with his name on the floor. He opened the envelope and much to his delight were two items. One item was a hotel key card. The second item was a note in Sarah's handwriting saying, &quot;I'm Ready. Love, Sarah.&quot; 
[ Using deep POV and internal dialogue, write the end of the scene reflecting Evan's overwhelming excitement that Sarah is ready to make love. The scene should end with Evan's exciting reaction to the envelope. ]
Objectives/Goals:
This scene primarily reflects Evan's euphoric and giddy emotional state resulting from both his profession of love for Sarah, the end to an exciting evening at the fundraiser, and the wonderment of his first ever stay at a luxury hotel.
Props/Items:
Mini-fridge.
Shower.
Towel.
Window.
Bed, TV remote, TV.
Envelope slipped under Evan's door containing Sarah's room key and the note telling Evan Sarah is ready to make love.

            <Title>Suzanne Collins</Title>
            <Text>For Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, senior year at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign began as an ordinary semester, the two strangers running in distinct circles. 
Evan, known for his athletic prowess and magnetic personality, drew attention without effort, though never letting it cloud his judgement. Raised by his compassionate sister, Liz, Evan treated all with kindness, be it a football star or a shy water boy. However, the academia was never his strongest suit, not due to lack of intellect, but his love for the open air and disdain for classroom boundaries. Nonetheless, he had a promise to Liz: to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA. So he traded the thrill of Frisbee games for quietude in the library, much to his friend Guido's disappointment. 
In contrast, Sarah was a powerhouse student, her sights set on graduating top of her class. The library was her sanctuary, the site of countless hours spent on her audio seminars and preparation for the Business-101 class she taught. Her life was a race against the clock, meticulously planned, her only companion her relentless ambition. The daughter of a tycoon, she was destined to be the future CEO of her father's company. She believed in a life devoid of romantic involvements until her Masters' degree was in hand. 
As fate would have it, their paths crossed when Sarah, engrossed in her seminar, nearly tripped down a set of stairs. Evan, sensing danger, sprinted to her aid, saving her in a sweeping embrace that culminated in an unexpected, passionate kiss. After the startling interaction, Sarah fled the scene, leaving behind only her glasses.
Days later, Evan located Sarah and returned her glasses, now repaired. Despite her attempts to remain focused, Sarah found herself capitulating to his charm, agreeing to join him for a break in the food court. Confronted with his popularity and the stark contrast between their lives, Sarah fled again, only to be pursued by Evan. They shared another electrifying kiss and agreed on a date. 
In preparation, Sarah turned to Katie Andrews, a bright student from her class, who, along with her hairstylist friend, assisted in updating Sarah's appearance and fashion. While getting a makeover, Sarah found herself reconsidering her stringent policy against romantic engagements. If she were to venture into this territory, she decided, it would be under calculated terms, safeguarding her academic aspirations. 
Evan agreed to her rules, love-struck since their first interaction. Their relationship flourished, with Sarah embracing her dormant romantic side and Evan improving academically with Sarah's help. As they savored the present, they remained silent about their future, Sarah wavering over her decision to attend an Ivy League school, and Evan planning a surprise proposal at their graduation party. 
At the party, Evan's proposal shocked Sarah. All her rationality screamed 'no', but she found herself saying 'yes', too consumed by love to refuse. The consequence was a potentially disapproving encounter with her father, who she had deceived about the intensity of her relationship with Evan. 
Her father presented two options: follow Evan to Chicago and begin a life with him while continuing her Masters, or stick to her initial plan. He would not force her to end her engagement, but if she chose Evan over the family business, his financial support would cease. 
Sarah found herself torn. She knew Evan's commitment to his sister and his promising job opportunity in Chicago, and she felt guilty about asking him to wait for her. The choice was clear, yet difficult: follow her meticulously planned path or surrender to the unpredictable allure of love. Ultimately, against all odds, Sarah chose Evan, her heart triumphing over logic.</Text>

            <Title>0210 Sarah Prepares Her Apartment for Evan's Arrival</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah prepares for Evan's first visit to her apartment.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was the Friday night following the Sunday softball game. The rain tapped on the windows of Sarah's apartment, a soft accompaniment to the distant rumbles of thunder. Inside, the atmosphere was warm and cozy, filled with the soft glow of lamps and the scent of fresh flowers. Sarah carefully arranged study supplies and educational materials on the dining room table, her mind swirling with thoughts and emotions.
The dining room table, large and stylish, served more than just its apparent purpose. Sarah used it as a spread for her study materials. Its wooden surface gleamed under the light, a reflection of her meticulous nature.
Sarah needed to decide whether to cook or order out for her date with Evan. She only had a little experience as a cook. Her regular meal routine involved preparing simple, lean meals for the week ahead on Sunday nights. It was a time-saving method to ensure that she always ate properly. Indeed, there were better options than feeding Evan a previously prepared lean meal.
Tonight was about indulgence, about trying something new. Not knowing Evan's preferences but trusting Katie's advice that all college men, especially those from Chicago, were addicted to pizza, she'd placed menus from local pizzerias on the table. Sarah was sure she’d tried pizza in the past but couldn't recollect when that was. 
Sarah's transformation from her stressful post-game party on Sunday to this calm and optimistic state was a journey she looked back on with a mix of amusement and relief. Her conversation earlier in the week with Katie had played a crucial role in bringing her to this point.
I overreacted, she thought, recalling Katie's words. I made a mountain out of a molehill.
The wisdom in Katie's advice struck her, reminding her of similar guidance she'd offered girls in her high school honor classes. She found humor in her dramatic reaction to a typical college party, knowing now that she would never let it turn into a crisis again.
Dressed in jeans, a casual pullover T-shirt, and slip-on shoes, Sarah moved to the mirror for a last-minute check. Her reflection showed a relaxed and confident young woman, ready for the evening. She liked her new look and the comfort of her clothes. She felt at ease.
Throughout the week, Sarah's communication with Evan had been limited to texts. She'd been careful, taking time before replying. Though she wanted to respond instantly, talk to him on the phone, and see him in person, she'd intentionally slowed down, allowing herself time to catch up on her academic studies and nonprofit commitments.
Now, everything is in place, she thought, her heart light with anticipation.
Tonight was what she'd envisioned when she'd decided to enter a relationship with Evan. Just him and her, alone, enjoying each other's company. An evening where she could let go and explore the emotional side of herself without any distractions.
A knock on the door pulled her from her thoughts. It was Evan. The sound resonated through the apartment, a herald of the night ahead.</Text>

            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: Evan Finds Sarah at the library
Summary: 0125 Evan Finds Sarah at the library
Characters: Evan, Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Time of Day: Morning
Locations: Undergrad Library
Tone: Sweet, cute, charming, playful
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
Although the weather is not apparent from underground, Evan just entered from outside and knew it was a perfect day. Feel free to have Evan use this information to persuade Sarah to take a break on a beautiful day and walk with him to the food court.
This is meant to be a high-energy, fun, and playful scene. After not seeing each other since the day of their kiss, the chemistry between them upon their second meeting is palpable.
While Sarah is still reluctant and somewhat resistant, Evan is all in. In this scene, we can see how Evan's charm and persistence will eventually shatter her resistance.
This is the third scene at this location, so we don't need to be overly descriptive of the setting—just small descriptions of their surroundings as required in the scene. 
Please make sure to include the dialogue and actions from scene elements 27 through 30 verbatim in all versions of this scene.
It's important to note that he still does not know Sarah's name, nor does she know his until the next scene.
Sequence of Events:
The scene begins with Evan walking into the library, his eyes scanning panoramically, seeking Sarah.
Evan was confident that close up, he could identify her. But he wasn’t sure he would recognize her from a distance. This became a moot point since only one student in the library was dressed in a business suit and wore her hair in a bun. There was no mistake he had found his mystery girl.
Sarah spotted Evan just as he headed toward her, and she slumped in her seat and pulled her book over her face, unsuccessfully trying to hide.
Evan approached Sarah. He smiled and waited patiently as her eyes peeked up at him from behind the book she was pretending to read. She lowered the book and sat up in her chair.
Evan held out the glasses that he had fixed and asked, “May I?” Sarah’s heart beat fast as she nodded.
 Her breathing increased, and her eyes closed as his hands moved toward her face. He carefully removed her glasses and replaced them with the glasses he repaired.
Following is a draft of the dialogue. The goal is to show Evan being cute and charming and Sarah finding him too charming to resist. And against her better judgment breaking from her study to go to the food court with him and get to know each other better.
Evan: “Ah, much better. Not that there’s anything wrong with the glasses you were wearing, but I like these a lot better. I hope I did a good job fixing them?”
Sarah: “Yes, you did. Thank you. How much do I owe you?”
Evan: “You don’t owe me anything! But you can join me for a snack at the food court. We could call it an energy exchange?”
Sarah was struggling to resist her desire to go with Evan.“I have studying to do.”
Evan: “You can’t take a half-hour break?”
Sarah: “No, I have a lot to study.”
Evan: “Well, I have to study too!”
Evan disappeared between two bookshelves. He returned to the table, sat across from Sarah, and intentionally read his book upside down.
Sarah: “Do you always read your books upside down?”
Evan turned the book right side up. “Ah, now this book makes more sense!”
Sarah laughed after reading the title, Female Poets of the 19th Century. “Really? You don’t look like a poetry major to me.”
Evan: “I love the female poets of the 19th century.”
Sarah: “Can you even name one?”
Evan: “Emily Dickinson!”
Sarah: “Do you know that, or is she the only female poet you’ve heard of?”
“I am an expert on female poetry from the 19th century!” joked Evan.
Sarah laughed. “You are, are you? Okay then, what is your favorite poem?” 
Evan looked down at the book. Sarah interrupted him.
“Close the book. Okay, now tell me your favorite poem.” 
He spun his whimsical tale. 
Evan: “Well, I can’t remember who wrote it, but I remember the name. It’s called The Kiss. It’s a poem about this beautiful coed saved from certain death by a valiant young man. They have this most amazing kiss. But then she disappears like Cinderella at midnight. He ultimately finds her, and she futilely attempts to resist his charming ways.”
Sarah smiled. “Hmm, interesting. So how does the poem end?” 
Evan: “Happily ever after, of course!”
Evan’s charm weakened her resolve as she attempted to refocus on her study material. Evan opened the book again and altered his facial expression and voice to mimic a distinguished professor.
He pretended to critique a poem.“Very nice. Excellent poetic structure. Great use of hyperbole.”
Sarah giggled. “You are going to keep annoying me until I agree to go to the food court, aren’t you?”
Evan: “Annoying? I was shooting for charming!”
Sarah laughed. “Okay, fine, annoyingly charming.”
Evan’s tone turned a bit more serious. “I’ll stop bothering you if you want. But I say let’s get to know each other. Unless I imagined it, that kiss was wonderful for you, too. All I’m asking for is 15 minutes. That’s it, just 15 minutes of your time! What do you say?”
Sarah relented and silently packed up her stuff.
“Is that a yes?” he asked.
 Sarah: “Yes, it is!” 
Sarah gathered up her stuff. Evan asked very gentlemanly as he motioned her to walk in front of him, and when they got to the door, he opened it for her. The scene will end at this point. The reader should be left feeling good about what happened and great anticipation for what comes next. Chemistry and romance are in the air.</Text>

            <Title>James Patterson</Title>
            <Text>In the bustling arena of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, two seniors whose paths never crossed, found themselves entangled in a saga that was far from ordinary. 
Evan Vaughn was not just another handsome face on campus. He was the alluring, athletic gentleman whose popularity was magnified by his humility and kindness. A man molded by his saintly sister Liz, Evan didn't let his charm overshadow his true self. Yet, his intellectual potential was hidden beneath his love for the outdoors and a promise he made to Liz, to graduate with a respectable 3.0 GPA.
Sarah Wilkins, unlike Evan, was the embodiment of academic brilliance. Destined to sit atop her class, she found solace in the sterile confines of the university library, consumed by her dedication to excel. As a business major, her promise to her father and herself was simple yet stringent: No romantic distractions until she ascended to the helm of her father's multimillion-dollar corporation.
The monotony of their separate lives was disrupted when Evan, playing the reluctant hero, saved Sarah from a near-disastrous fall on campus. In a twist fit for a Patterson novel, their heated encounter ended in a passionate kiss, leaving Sarah to battle the inner turmoil of emotions she was unprepared for.
In the aftermath, Evan finds Sarah again, returns her misplaced glasses, and relentlessly attempts to break the shell of her self-imposed solitude. Succumbing to Evan's charm, Sarah eventually agrees to date him, but not without laying down a series of strict rules, a reflection of her business-like approach to life.
Their relationship, though thriving on passion, was not devoid of complications. The unforeseen turn of events at their graduation party was a testament to this. Evan's surprise proposal in front of an unsuspecting audience, including Sarah's parents, rocked the very foundation of Sarah's meticulously planned future.
As Sarah grappled with the aftermath of the proposal, her father, a stoic yet fair man, presented her with an ultimatum: Follow her original plan and join him in Seattle after obtaining her Master's, or carve a new path with Evan in Chicago at the expense of her father's financial support.
In classic James Patterson style, this tale crescendos with Sarah's monumental decision. Facing the crossroads between her longstanding plan and the life she never imagined, she defies the odds, choosing Evan and her heart, thus beginning a thrilling journey into an unknown future.</Text>
            <Notes>[This scene is written in the style of James Patterson, using his distinctive fast-paced narrative and stark, high-contrast emotional landscape.]

            <Text>Rewriting and splitting the scene as requested:

**Scene 1:**
Evan had been strategic, leading Sarah on a route that unavoidably passed the spot of their first kiss. He paused there, gazing at her with an intensity that made her heart thump against her ribs. &quot;I’ve been waiting to kiss you again since the first moment I saw you today,” he confessed, his voice rough.
Gently, Evan's fingers curled around hers, the sensation setting a tremor of awareness coursing through her. &quot;Come with me,&quot; he suggested, his voice as soft and alluring as the hold he had on her hand.
Sarah recoiled slightly, confusion flickering in her eyes. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked, her tone wavering between uncertainty and curiosity.
“I’m holding your hand.” His reply was casual, as though it were the most natural thing in the world. Anticipating her need for an explanation, he added, “I figured it was okay. Everything less than that is allowed once you’ve gone to a certain point with someone. Since we already kissed twice, holding hands seems a given.”
Despite the knots of anxiety tying her stomach into pretzel-like twists, Sarah discovered she couldn't quite fight off the lure of Evan’s infectious confidence. His logic was faultless, and the thought occurred to her—That does make sense!—adding an almost humorous slant to her internal dilemma. As they meandered through the bustling food court, immersed in the vibrant chatter that encapsulated the university's social scene, she felt her hand comfortably nestle into his. 
The food court was a vibrant hub of activity. Students moved to and fro, their laughter and discussions creating an ambient hum that echoed around the vast space. The air was rich with the tantalizing scent of food from different cultures, and the murals that adorned the walls injected a youthful energy into the surroundings. Amid the chaos and noise, Sarah and Evan stood out, their hands interlocked in a silent promise of an unforeseen journey.
But with every passing minute, Sarah’s unease grew. The constant acknowledgement Evan received from the other students, the knowing looks, and the insinuating whispers from the predominantly female crowd were disconcerting. She wondered if she'd become an intruder in his world. She began to question why he had chosen her of all people. 
With an unexpected prompt from Evan, they found themselves seated at a table, the noise and activity of the food court reduced to a dull hum in the background. Evan returned shortly with bottles of water and fruit cups, a simple and light snack as per Sarah’s request.
They began with the basics. An exchange of names, of basic introductions. But when Evan asked her to share something about herself, she found herself caught in an awkward limbo. Nervousness snuck up on her, strangling her words and turning her eloquent academic accomplishments into a frantic, tumble of phrases. 
As the minutes passed, Sarah could feel the weight of awkwardness settle over them. The thrill of their earlier encounter was rapidly giving way to her self-doubt and anxiety. When it became too much, Sarah fled. Her flight triggered by her own insecurities, fear, and uncertainty.

**Scene 2:**

Evan was quick on his feet. He chased after her, calling out, “Hey, Cinderella, wait up, wait up!” His voice echoed around her as he finally caught up.

She stopped abruptly, pivoting to face him. Her eyes were wide, her breaths quick. “Why do you call me Cinderella?”

“Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”

His words were a playful challenge, one that made her insides twist uncomfortably. “Why do you keep pursuing me? It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.” 

They both knew she had a point. Their worlds were vastly different, their paths almost impossible to align. But Evan persisted. He wanted to understand her, get to know her. But more importantly, he wanted her to see that he was not intimidated by her genius IQ, her different world. He wanted to step into her world, and he wanted her to step into his.

A tug of war ensued, their words, their feelings, and their attraction battling against their different worlds. Their conversation veered from Evan’s popularity among females to Sarah’s commitment to her education and career. Through it all, Evan maintained a relentless interest in Sarah, a spark of fascination that was impossible to ignore.

As their conversation progressed, Sarah found herself slowly crumbling under Evan’s onslaught of well-meaning persuasion. When Evan suggested that they try to find out why they were drawn to each other by going on a date, Sarah was left reeling, her defenses weakening.

His plea for her to enjoy the college life beyond academics was convincing. He posed questions that had her rethinking her carefully laid out plan. Evan had a way of disrupting her thoughts, her rigidity, and she found it both unsettling and invigorating. His kisses didn't help, sending her mind into a tizzy, clouding her usual sharp intelligence.

Despite the whirlwind of feelings, Sarah agreed to go on a date with Evan. A small step, a minor concession, but a step nonetheless. They parted ways with a promise to meet for a date, their connection deepened by the sweet sting of their shared kisses.

*Author's style: This scene is written using the close third-person perspective, with an emotional, character-driven narrative focusing on internal conflict and dialogue. The tone fluctuates between sweet, funny, intriguing, exciting, and frantic, reflecting</Text>

&quot;Two.&quot; Sarah's response came as a quiet murmur.
&quot;Is your roommate home?&quot; Katie inquired, her visual exploration of the apartment ongoing.
Sarah negated with a shake of her head. &quot;It’s just me. My father insisted I have an extra bedroom that I could use as an office. But I never use the guest room, I prefer to  work at the dining room table where I can spread out, or in my bedroom before I go to sleep.&quot;
The idea of privacy, the luxury of space, left Katie yearning. &quot;I can’t even imagine what it’s like not to share a room. Living in a tiny dorm room with a chatty roommate, makes it impossible to study.&quot;
An understanding hovered between them, thick and unspoken. As Katie's gaze made another sweep across the grand expanse of the apartment, Sarah seized the moment. With the effusive warmth of a mother granting her child a long-cherished wish, she said, &quot;You know, the guest room's always open if you ever need a quiet study sanctuary!&quot;
&quot;Really! Thank you!&quot; With those words, Katie lunged forward and gave Sarah a big hug. Sarah was taken by surprise, her glass of wine tilting precariously, the liquid inside nearly sloshing out onto her hand. But she quickly righted the glass and returned Katie's embrace, welcoming the warmth of her gratitude.
As Katie was about to open her mouth to dive into another subject, the familiar buzz of her cell phone diverted her attention. She quickly glanced at the screen, her eyebrows arching slightly. &quot;Oh, it's Nicole, my hairstylist,&quot; she explained. &quot;She wants to confirm our appointment and she needs a picture of you to start making a plan for your makeover.&quot;
Sarah blinked in surprise but then smiled in response. &quot;Alright, let's do it.&quot;
Katie quickly captured a picture of Sarah, her fingers flying over the phone as she sent the image to Nicole. Within moments, Nicole responded with a flurry of excited emojis, already expressing her eagerness to work on Sarah's transformation. 
Katie asked, &quot;So altogether, including new clothes and hairstylist, what kind of budget are we talking?&quot; 
&quot;No budget constraints, you're in charge!&quot; Sarah said with a playful grin.
Katie's eyes lit up at this and she squealed, clapping her hands in excitement. &quot;Really? Oh, this is going to be so much fun!&quot;
The energy in the room was effervescent, reflecting off Sarah as her own excitement began to bubble up. It was new, this anticipation of a date, of being made over, of possibly breaking her own rules, but it was an invigorating feeling that Sarah welcomed.
Katie, full of curiosity, veered the conversation towards Sarah's dating past. &quot;You said it had been a while since you dated?&quot; She was already conjuring up different makeovers in her mind, ready to transform Sarah for her date.
Sarah admitted, a hint of wistfulness in her voice. 'I haven’t dated since I was 16.'&quot;
&quot;16? Wowza!&quot; Katie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. But she wasn't done probing, her next question laced with a touch of delicacy. &quot;If you don’t mind me asking, are you a...&quot; She paused, &quot;virgin?&quot;
&quot;No, I’m not a virgin,&quot; Sarah confessed, the hesitation barely noticeable. &quot;I experimented for a short time in high school, but I didn't see what was so great about it.&quot;
Katie leaned in closer, her voice a comforting whisper. &quot;It will be way different when you find the right guy.” 
A mischievous twinkle lit up in Sarah's eyes, an expression that silently echoed, &quot;Maybe!?&quot; This was a different Sarah, one who was open to the possibility of something more, something exciting, something like... Evan.
Seizing the moment, Katie ventured to ask, &quot;Do you think the guy you’re meeting tonight–“
Sarah interrupted, &quot;Evan.&quot; 
Katie continued, &quot;Evan, may be the right guy?&quot;
The response was immediate, Sarah's smile reaching her eyes as she raised her eyebrows. &quot;He's the right guy if he makes love even half as good as he kisses!&quot; 
Their giggles echoed around the room, the atmosphere brimming with anticipation and the sheer joy of newfound possibilities. The girls were truly ready for a night that promised to be a roller coaster of emotions and revelations.
Katie's head tilted slightly, a silent question in her eyes. The puzzle of how a date came to be from a runner's flight was intriguing. Sarah's words offered the missing piece; Evan had sought her out in the library, persistent and charming. Despite her best attempts to stay true to her policy, she found herself succumbing to the magnetic pull of Evan's appeal.
A knowing smile danced on Katie's lips as she watched Sarah's face transform, a touch of red gracing her cheeks. It was evident; the rule, the policy Sarah had held on to so firmly, had been fractured. A spark of defiance lit up in her eyes, an implicit admission of breaking her no-dating policy.
Katie's features softened into a warm, knowing smile. &quot;So you decided to step beyond your no-dating policy?&quot; Her tone carried no judgment; instead, it was rich with approval, almost as if she had been waiting for Sarah to allow herself this freedom.
Sarah shrugged, a hint of sheepishness creeping into her features. &quot;I didn’t have a choice. Every time he kisses me, I can’t think straight. Since the moment I met him, I haven’t been able to study or focus on anything. All I think about is him. Maybe this date will help clear my mind.&quot;
&quot;Are you hoping this date will lead to something more?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes glinting with mischief.
&quot;I have thought a lot about that. If I could find a way to have a relationship with Evan without being distracted from my work, I would like that. The thought of having someone by my side when attending an event or someone to hang out with here at home, appeals to me. But, I have a feeling it’s not going to be that simple.&quot;
Katie nodded, taking in Sarah's words. &quot;Well, if you ask me, I think you are doing the right thing. You can't let your studies keep you from living your life. There is always a way to make things work. You just have to find your balance.&quot;
Katie said, &quot;We need  to get going. Let's get you changed into something more fun for our shopping trip. Can we look at your wardrobe? I want to see if there's anything we can use for tonight.”</Text>

            <Title>Abbie Jimenez</Title>
            <Text>The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is the stage for this deliciously fun, romantically tumultuous story that features our two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn. These two have never crossed paths before, and they seem to be complete opposites. 
Evan, a naturally charismatic and outgoing, is the kind of guy everyone on campus gravitates toward. Not just because of his stunning looks or athletic prowess, but because he genuinely treats everyone with kindness and respect. You would think that he is a bookworm just like Sarah, given his desire to maintain a 3.0 GPA, a promise to his amazing sister Liz. But actually, he would rather spend his time exploring the outdoors rather than being cooped up indoors studying.
Sarah, however, is the university's top-notch student, destined to graduate with flying colors. She's not just book-smart; she's also teaching a Business-101 class to freshmen. But that's not all there is to Sarah. Underneath her academic exterior, there's a side of her that hasn't yet had a chance to shine - the side that craves romance and human connection.
Their paths cross in an intense, cinematic moment where Evan saves Sarah from a nasty fall. Sparks fly and a heated, unexpected kiss follows. And just like that, Sarah's world is turned upside down. 
Sarah's been focused on her academics and career goals. She promised herself to avoid romance until after graduation, a pact she also made with her father. Yet, she can't help but be drawn to Evan. And when he finds her again to return her lost glasses, she can't resist his charm anymore. They agree to date, but not before Sarah outlines clear rules to ensure her academic goals aren't compromised. Evan agrees, not because he doesn't care, but because he's hopelessly in love.
Their senior year unfolds into a beautifully chaotic ride. Evan becomes a better student, and Sarah learns to enjoy life beyond her books. But as graduation looms, so do life's big decisions.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan is planning a grand proposal at their graduation party. To make matters more complicated, Evan secretly invites Sarah's parents. Sarah, utterly surprised, says yes, despite knowing she would have to readjust her life plans. Her parents, not fully aware of the depth of their relationship, leave in shock.
Sarah's father later presents her with a choice: stick to their agreed-upon plan of joining him in Seattle after pursuing her Master's or follow her heart with Evan in Chicago. The catch is, if she chooses Evan, she will lose her father's financial support. 
In classic Abbie Jimenez fashion, this tale delivers a high-stakes, emotionally charged decision. Sarah's logical side screams to stick to the plan, but her heart whispers to follow her love for Evan. And just like that, she chooses love. She chooses Evan. And with that, Sarah embarks on her path towards a life filled with love and adventure, a testament to the power of choosing happiness over the expected.</Text>
            <Notes>[This scene is written in the style of Abbie Jimenez, where internal conflicts and emotions are presented with a vibrant and relatable narrative.] </Notes>

Location Profile:
Name of the place: Business-101 Classroom 
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign/Urbana
Type of place: Large classroom
What role does this setting play in the story?
As a teacher's assistant, Sarah teaches first-year students enrolled in Business-101 in this large classroom once a week. 
This was the very classroom Sarah rushed into right after sharing her first kiss with Evan. Unusually late, she disrupted her otherwise flawless track record as a teaching assistant. Overwhelmed by the unexpected romantic encounter with Evan, she became uncharacteristically disorganized, jotting down lessons on the board that hadn't even been introduced yet.
In that moment, a more vulnerable and relatable version of Sarah emerged. While her students typically found her classes somewhat monotonous, they were pleasantly surprised by this unexpected shift in her demeanor. Thrown off balance by her interaction with Evan, Sarah managed to instruct in a manner that captivated her students, allowing them to see her in a new light. They realized that Sarah, contrary to their assumptions, was not one-dimensional but had a unique and engaging personality.
A week later, the same room served as the setting for another significant moment. Sarah approached one of her students, Katie, requesting assistance in preparing for her first date since she was a teenager. Eager to help, Katie readily agreed to give Sarah a modern makeover for her impending date with Evan.
Description: 
The University of Illinois boasted a sizable classroom where wisdom echoed off the walls and into the minds of its students. Laid out like a grand theater, the room contained over a dozen rows of tiered seating, reminiscent of the captivating cinematic venues. These rows were broken up into three sections, the flanking ones each housing six seats, while the central section accommodated a more significant twelve.
In an unconventional setting, the room featured no student desks; instead, each seat was designed such that the students could comfortably use their laps as makeshift writing surfaces. Each maroon seat, dark and durable, was affixed to its neighbor, contributing to the seamless, theater-like aesthetic.
Stairs conveniently partitioned the seating sections, providing easy access to each row, all the way up to the back of this spacious room. Looking up, the eyes were met with towering 30-foot ceilings, amplifying the grandeur of the classroom.
The teacher's area was flanked by an expansive whiteboard, dominating the wall space behind it. A wooden podium held court beside a similarly constructed desk, complete with an office chair nestled behind it, providing an organized yet inviting space for the instructor.
Two speakers, adhered to either side of the whiteboard, hung from the wall, ready to amplify the voice of knowledge resonating from the front of the room. The aesthetics of the room were warm yet disciplined, with chestnut-colored wood cladding the walls up to four feet from the ground. Above this wooden adornment, vanilla-painted walls ascended toward the lofty ceiling, providing a soothing contrast to the dark wood below.
Scattered symmetrically on both walls to the left and right of the seating were several identical pieces of neutral geometric artwork, adding a touch of creative elegance to the otherwise academic surroundings. These unobtrusive designs complemented the room's austere charm, contributing to the vibrant yet studious ambiance that permeated this well-loved classroom at the University of Illinois.</Text>
            <Notes>This is the classroom that Sarah went to immediately after Evan's and her’s first kiss. She was late for the first time in her teaching assistant career. When she arrived, she was uncharacteristically frazzled from her first kiss with Evan and started writing on the board material that had not been covered.
We see a more vulnerable and relatable version of Sarah at that moment. Typically her students find her class boring. But unsettled by her experience with Evan, she actually taught in a way the students enjoyed and could relate to. Her student got to see that indeed she does have a personality and is not as one-dimensional as they thought.
A week later, this location provides the venue for the scene where Sarah asks one of her students, Katie, to help her prepare for her first date since she was 16. Katie gladly offers to help Sarah with a modern makeover for her date with Evan.</Notes>

Evan protagonist in the story.
Beliefs: 
Evan, believes in the guiding influence of the &quot;Universe&quot; on people's life experiences. While he understands the Universe does not reveal its ultimate plan, he thinks it provides opportunities and signs to help humans navigate their journey.
Why does Evan withdraw and sometimes shut down when his suffering emotional duress?
Although Evan would benefit from talking to others who care about him when he suffers emotionally, he pulls away from others when in emotional pain. The reasons Evan gives for withdrawing when he is suffering are:
He doesn't like to draw attention to himself.
He surmises that the past is the past and cannot be changed. He sees no value in discussing painful memories and experiences that cannot be changed?
Most importantly to Evan, he doesn't want to bring negative energy to others. He would rather pull away and process the pain himself, in solitude. Then when he feels recovered, he crawls out of his hole and brings positive energy to the people around him.
What were Evan's romantic relationships like in college prior to meeting Sarah?
Although Evan doesn't perceive himself as a hopeless romantic, that is who he is. In order to love a woman romantically, he must feel that special chemistry with the woman that cannot be manufactured or faked.
However, Evan doesn't like to be alone, so he still has relationships while he waits for that special connection. Before meeting Sarah, he had never experienced that special chemical connection with anyone else.
Others would describe Evan as having a handful of girlfriends during college before meeting Sarah. However, he never considered the women that he went out with as girlfriends.
If he took a particular liking to a college coed but was not in love with her, he would start paying more attention to her. This special attention often misled these women into thinking he was their boyfriend. Because of Evan's vow to never even date two women at a time, when he would enter into an intimate relationship with the woman he liked but didn't love, he considered that relationship as friends with benefits. However, to the woman, she thought Evan was now her boyfriend.
After a few months in one of these relationships, Evan starts to pull out of the relationship and inadvertently breaks the woman's heart. However, it was college, and relationships were more casual then. So, it was never an overly dramatic situation.
Women just assumed that Evan had a fear of commitment. That wasn't true at all. Evan craved being in a committed relationship, but only if he was madly in love with his partner.
When he met Sarah, all the pieces fell into place for Evan. He fell immediately in love and was more than ready to commit to a relationship and call her his girlfriend. 
So, while others would've considered Sarah his sixth or seven girlfriend during college, Evan considered Sarah his first girlfriend and, ultimately, his first love.
It's important to note, that while Evan attracted the most beautiful women on campus, beauty was not his top priority when it came to his attraction to women. For Evan, attraction was about personality and chemistry.
Is Evan an introvert or an extrovert?
To label Evan as either an introvert or an extrovert would be a mistake. When suffering emotional duress, his propensity to withdraw might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state of being.
On the other hand, because of his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and befriending others, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred to avoid drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by conscious choice, but his good looks and warm personality made him popular. Whether someone were the star quarterback or the worst student in college, Evan would treat everyone kindly.
While Evan did not embrace his popularity, he humbly accepted the situation, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.</Text>

POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Thai Garden Restaurant
Setting: A charming little Thai restaurant tucked away in a quieter corner of town. The place was an intimate cocoon, exuding an enchanting blend of modern aesthetic and traditional Thai decor. Warm, golden lighting cast a soft glow over the well-worn wooden tables and chairs, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. 
Ornate, hand-carved wooden panels adorned the walls, depicting scenes of Thai mythology and culture. Splashes of vibrant silk fabrics, used as table runners and curtains, added rich pops of color, complemented by the sweet aroma of exotic spices wafting from the kitchen.
The centerpiece of the establishment was a small wishing well situated near the waiting area. Crafted from aged stone and moss, it was an unexpected touch that lent an air of whimsy to the place. Trickling water cascaded down, producing a soothing melody that added to the tranquil ambiance. A collection of coins glistened at the bottom, tossed by hopeful patrons making silent wishes. It was a charming symbol of the restaurant's welcoming and dreamy atmosphere, offering a unique touch to their dining experience.
Tone: Exciting, hopeful, anticipatory, friendly

Draft Scene:
[[ Upon exiting the Thai Garden Restaurant, Evan gently took Sarah’s hand and walked her to her car. Neither Sarah nor Evan said much during this time as they both were busy absorbing the night’s events. When they arrived at Sarah’s car, she turned around and leaned against the driver’s side door.]]
[[Evan looked at Sarah deep in her eyes]]  
Evan: “Now I am ready to seal the deal.”
[[ Evan leaned in to kiss a wanting Sarah. This was their longest kissing session to date. The kiss started intimately before transitioning to deep passion. There was a drastic change in energy from the contract negotiations at dinner. ]]
Sarah: “I love the way I feel when you kiss me, but it scares me. You have this power over me. It’s intoxicating. I apologize for my business-like approach. I’ve never had a real romantic relationship before, and I’m struggling with the fear of losing control”
Evan: “Never apologize for being who you are. You have the same power over me. It doesn’t scare me, though. It feels like I have been waiting for you. I’ve never felt this way about anybody before. I understand this is unfamiliar territory for you. I promise I won’t pressure you to do anything before you’re ready.”
[[Sarah donned a sexy smile.]]
Sarah:  “I sense you won’t have to wait too long.”
Evan: [[Asked Hopefully]] “I like the sound of that! I don’t suppose you have time to hang out more tonight?”
Sarah: “Not tonight. My friend Katie is waiting for me back at my apartment. I will be there on Sunday to see your game.” 
[[ Sarah could see that this made Evan happy. ]]
Evan: “I have a gift for you.” 
[[ Evan pulled a box out of his pocket. In the box was a silver pendant attached to a silver chain. The pendant was a tiny set of eyeglasses. ]]
Evan: “May I put this on you, my Cinderella?” 
[[ Sarah turned around so that Evan could put the necklace around her neck. She turned back around to face Evan while holding the pendant in her hand, examining it. She could see the pride on Evan's face, but she was not sure what to make of it. 
Evan could see perplexed look on Sarah's face as she examined. He decided to jump in and share the story of the necklace and how he had it custom-made. as he clasped the necklace on her neck. ]]
Evan: “You know how I call you my Cinderella because you’re always running away from me?” 
[[ Sarah nodded in agreement. ]]
[[I'm going to provide you with what Evan would have said on the date. However, you're free to summarize this and focus more on how Sarah is feeling when Evan tells story.
The reason you don't have to tell is verbatim, is that in scene 0137, the reader was there when Evan was having this necklace and its special charm made. In my feel repetitive for the reader to have Evan relive the details of the finding in making of the pendant, when they just read about it a few chapters ago.
Of course, Sarah needs to hear all the details, that doesn't mean that the reader. Has to hear them along with her.  So use the following paragraphs of information and what you know of scene 0137 to describe what Evan is saying to Sarah. 
Note that it is also okay to include some dialogue from Evan while Sarah is us and tell story it doesn't have to all be narrative, I'll leave that up to you.
So here's an example and Evan might have said to Sarah after giving her the necklace.
Evan: “I wanted to get you something for our date tonight, and I wanted it to be unique. While shopping, I ran across this glass case with a bunch of small Cinderella-type glass slippers and shoes. It turns out people collect these things. They gave me the idea of a necklace with an eyeglass pendant inspired by the glasses you left behind while making your escape.” Sarah smiled embarrassingly at Evan’s comment.
Evan continued, “I couldn’t find any necklaces like that. I shopped at all the toy stores I could find. But I couldn’t find anything that would work. I even tried the toy sections at the department stores, nothing. I was about to give up when I passed by this antique store. And what do you know, the universe plopped an antique doll with the perfect size glasses right in the window for me to see.
I bought the doll and took the glasses to a jeweler to have the glasses attached to a chain. The jeweler suggested dipping it in silver so that it would last forever. Forever sounded good to me, so I had him do that. I mean it to commemorate our first kiss. Whenever you wear it, I want you to remember that magical moment,” Evan said in a soft, sentimental voice. ]]
[[ Teardrops flowed down Sarah’s cheeks. ]]
Sarah: “Thank you, Evan. That’s so romantic and so sweet. I can’t believe I’m crying. I haven’t cried since I was a child.”
[[ Evan pulled Sarah close and hugged her. ]]
“Does that mean you like it?”
[[ If Sarah had seen a necklace with a charm like this without any context. She would've not found it all that appealing. She might even find it juvenile, like something a preteen would wear. However in this situation, she generally saw its beauty and felt its sentiment. It indeed was the perfect gift for her. 
In her mind, at that moment, this necklace stood out far above all of her expensive jewelry that her parents had given her over the years to wear at countless business socials and charity balls. ]]
Sarah: “I love it! It’s the most wonderful, beautiful, stupendous gift I’ve ever received from anybody. I can’t believe I’m going to ask this, but if you kept the doll, may I have it?”
[[ Sarah was shocked at her own desire to have the dowel that Evan got the glasses from. She had no idea what to do with the doll. She can't even remember if she's ever even had a doll. All she knew was that she had to have the doll! – She just had to have it. ]]
Evan: “I will bring it on Sunday,” 
[[ Sarah thanks Evan profusely. Possibly gives him a sensual kiss in gratitude for his gift. Maybe a warm hug as well. ]]
Sarah:  “I don’t want this night to end, but I need to get home. My friend is waiting, and I have an early class tomorrow.”
Evan: “No Worries. Can I ask you for one more thing, maybe two?”
“You sure can,” Sarah replied.
Evan: “Can I get your last name? Maybe a phone number or an email?” Evan joked.
[[ Sarah laughed out loud. ]] 
Sarah: “Of course you can.” 
[[ She handed him a business card and told Evan to text his information to her. They enjoyed one more long passionate kiss before returning home.]]

            <Synopsis>An excited Evan meets Sarah near her car before the game. He gives her the vintage doll that she asked for.</Synopsis>

Scene Name: 0200 Evan Gives Sarah the Vintage Doll
Characters: Evan, Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Back story: Last Thursday evening marked the beginning of Evan and Sarah's formal relationship, solidified by a pact that resembled a contract. They outlined commitments to one another, with Sarah agreeing to attend as many of Evan's Sunday morning softball games as possible.
The evening was made even more special when Evan presented Sarah with an extraordinary gift. Finding a vintage doll adorned with tiny glasses, he enlisted a jeweler to coat the glasses in silver and fashion them into a pendant for a beautiful necklace. The sentiment of the gift resonated deeply with Sarah. She was so enamored with the unique creation that she requested to keep the vintage doll. Her request further bonded their newly forged connection.
Before meeting Evan, Sarah's wardrobe consisted mainly of business suits and designer gowns. Casual clothing was foreign to her. That was about to change when she befriended Katie, one of her Business-101 students. With the aid of her hairstylist Nicole, Katie gave Sarah a complete makeover for her date with Evan.
Sarah shared with Katie the unique contract-style relationship with Evan, including her commitments to attend his softball games and college parties, a stark contrast to her usual upscale philanthropic events.
Wanting to help Sarah blend in with Evan's friends and the college crowd, Katie and Sarah embarked on a shopping spree the Saturday before the softball game. The outing was a success, and Sarah's closet became fully equipped with the casual clothes typical of college students, symbolizing a transformation not just in her appearance but in her life's direction.
Another critical point to understand in this scene is that Sarah clarified that academics always come first in this scene, which leads to a funny moment. However, it also shows how Evan fully supports Sarah's academic priorities.
Setting:
Location: Softball fields in central Illinois
Time: Sunday morning
Weather: Partly sunny, a typical crisp, cool morning in early fall in central Illinois

Evan anxiously awaits in the parking lot of the softball fields his new girlfriend, Sarah.
She pulls up in her white Audi sedan.
She is just as excited as he is.
A passionate kiss is their greeting before a word is said.
Evan: “I've got something for you!”
[[ Sarah is excited. ]]
Sarah: “You Do?”
[[ Evan grabs the vintage doll from his car and hands it to Sarah. The typically stoic Sarah is giddy like a schoolgirl upon receiving her gift from Evan. Tears even came to her eyes as she remembered the sentimental nature of the gift – the pendant she was wearing today. The pendant cannot be seen because she's worried it will get damaged, so it's tucked under her sweatshirt. ]]
Evan: “Are you ready to meet my friends?”
Sarah: “I'm nervous but as ready as I'll ever be.”
[[ Evan gives her a reassuring hug and tells her not to worry.]]
[[ Sarah opens her car door and grabs a book. ]]
Sarah: &quot;Evan, do you mind if I read a book during your game?&quot;
[[ Evan smiles warmly and supportively. ]]
Evan: &quot;Of course, I don't mind. Our games can last as long as two hours, and I fully support and understand that your academics are your number one priority. I'm nothing but grateful that you're coming to my games. I know we just met, but for some reason, it feels like such an important thing. So yes, schoolbook and study material you need for any game.&quot;
[[ Sarah laughs, as she knows that Evan is unaware of the book’s title. This leads to a funny and sweet moment. ]]
[[ Sarah giggles. She feigns seriousness. ]]
Sarah: &quot;That's good to know; maybe I'll need to bring some study materials one day. But this book is not about academics.”
[[ She smiled widely and showed Evan the front of the book. It's titled Softball for Dummies. 
This causes a hearty laugh from both Sarah and Evan.  ]]
Sarah: “I don't know anything about sports. If I'm going to come to games, I want to understand them as best as I can.”
Evan: “You are so adorable!” 
[[ Sarah has never been called adorable by anyone. Endorphins flow. ]]
Evan: &quot;The game is about to start. Let’s go.&quot;
[[ Sarah's nervousness shows in her eyes and body language. ]]
Sarah:  “I think I need a kiss.&quot;
I will leave it to your discretion if she's asking for the kiss as a dose of encouragement or if she tells Evan she needs a kiss for encouragement. ]]
[[ The scene ends as they head toward the bleachers, where Evan will introduce Sarah to his inner circle group of friends. ]]

            <Notes>The transformation was new to her, a result of yesterday's shopping spree with Katie, who wanted to help her fit in with the college crowd.

Sarah's attire: She is wearing a cute knit hat, matching scarf, and five–finger mittens. They are intentionally the same color blue that adorns the University of Illinois school colors. She is wearing an orange and blue University of Illinois sweatshirt. A casual, comfortable pair of jeans and everyday, affordable ankle-high black zippered roots. 
He did not have his softball glove on him, though.</Notes>

            <Title>0140 Sarah Asks Katie For Help</Title>
            <Synopsis>After class, Sarah asked Katie to help her prepare for her date with Evan. Katie enthusiastically agrees.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah watched as her Business-101 students hunched over their exams, the silence of concentration heavy in the room. Her gaze landed on Katie Andrews, a freshman with a zest for life as vibrant as her pink-dyed hair. Scribbling on a folded piece of paper, Sarah placed it on Katie's desk. The note held a simple request, Can you meet me after class?
Katie was one of Sarah's brightest students - effervescent and friendly, with an infectious grin. When the last student had packed up and exited the large classroom, Katie made her way up to Sarah's desk.
&quot;Hi, Ms. Wilkins. What’s up?&quot; Katie asked, her brown eyes twinkling with curiosity.
Sarah took a deep breath and launched into the question that had been on her mind. &quot;Thank you for meeting with me. I’ve always admired your style, even though it’s different from my own. I have a first date tonight and want to look appropriate for the evening. I haven’t been on a date in a while, and I’m unsure what to wear.”
Katie's face lit up, &quot;I’d love to help!&quot; she said, brimming with enthusiasm. &quot;Are we talking wardrobe only or full makeover?”
Sarah pondered for a moment. &quot;Whatever you think is best.&quot;
&quot;Really! Oh my gosh, Ms. Wilkins, I would love to do a full makeover! The other girls are going to be so jealous.”
Sarah tilted her head, puzzled. “Why?” 
Katie grinned, revealing the unspoken fantasies of their class. “In this class, it’s every girl’s fantasy to do a makeover on you, and it’s every boy’s fantasy that by day you are this librarian-like professor, but at night you’re a sexy vixen.” She laughed and then added hurriedly, &quot;Oh no, I hope that didn’t sound offensive.&quot;
Shaking her head, Sarah let out a chuckle. “I’m not offended; I understand.” She could appreciate the humor and mild absurdity in Katie's words. &quot;What time is your date?”
“It’s at 7 PM at the Thai Garden Restaurant.”
Katie clapped her hands in excitement. “I heard that place has great food! Do you live off-campus?”
“Yes, I have an apartment about 10 minutes away.”
Katie's smile faltered a bit. &quot;I don’t have a car. Can you pick me up by the freshman dorms in about an hour?”
“I’ll be there,” confirmed Sarah, passing Katie a business card with her cell phone number. 
“Great! I can’t wait.” Katie's grin returned full force, and she threw her arms around Sarah in a spontaneous hug. &quot;If we are going to be friends, I’d like to call you by your first name. Would that be okay?”
Sarah couldn't help but return the hug, the nerves of her impending date temporarily forgotten. “Of course, my name is Sarah.”
&quot;Perfect, Sarah!&quot; Katie's eyes sparkled with anticipation. &quot;Get ready, because we're about to have a blast! It's going to be epic!&quot;</Text>

            <Title>Becky Wade</Title>
            <Text>In the early days of their senior year at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn existed as two separate universes. Unknown to each other, their paths had never crossed until fate decided to play its role.
Evan Vaughn, an embodiment of charm and athletic prowess, found himself loved by many. Despite his popularity, under his sister Liz's nurturing influence, he was a humble soul. From the football team captain to the bespectacled water boy, all received the same treatment of kindness and respect from Evan. 
Even though he had an innate knack for studies, Evan's heart danced outdoors, chasing winds and playing under the azure skies. However, he had given his word to Liz, promising a minimum 3.0 GPA on his graduation. And for Evan, promises were not to be broken, even if it meant sacrificing his favorite pastime for his books. As his GPA teetered close to his self-imposed threshold, Evan found himself headed to the unfamiliar territory of the undergrad library. 
Sarah, in contrast, was a prodigy, bound to be the valedictorian of her class. The library was her sanctuary, her comfort zone where she immersed herself in an audio seminar that held the secret to international business success. Oblivious to time, engrossed in her studies, she was on the brink of a first - being late to teach her Business-101 class. 
Sprinting up the library stairs, her earbuds secured in place, she burst out the door onto a raised campus platform. In her path lay a flight of concrete steps. Seeing her impending tumble, Evan dashed to intercept her. His call fell on her deaf ears, drowned out by the ongoing audio seminar. 
He reached her just in time, their bodies merging in a dance-like twirl, ending in a passionate kiss that set their world ablaze. Sarah, bred in an environment where academics took precedence over romance, was caught off guard. Her inexperienced heart fluttered in confusion. 
Even amidst the whirlwind of emotions, Sarah managed to escape without sharing her identity. Days later, Evan found her and returned her lost glasses. In an attempt to charm his way into her life, Evan invited her for a break at the food court. Despite her initial resistance, Sarah was captivated by Evan's allure. 
But doubts clouded her mind when she observed Evan's popularity, particularly among the coeds. Fleeing to her car, she was intercepted by Evan, their encounter leading to a date and a fiery kiss. 
To prepare for her date, Sarah sought assistance from Katie Andrews, a top student in her class. Together with Katie's hairstylist friend, they updated Sarah's style, giving her a modern look. 
Armed with her new look, Sarah approached her date with Evan like a business deal, setting rules and boundaries for their relationship. She prioritized her academic goals above all. Evan agreed, entranced by the captivating woman in front of him. 
As weeks passed, Sarah's hard exterior melted, exposing her softer, vulnerable side. Their date concluded with another fervent kiss and a memento from Evan that symbolized their unique love story. 
They thrived together, their relationship blossoming as Sarah grew more sociable and Evan improved his academic standing. Sarah's guidance even helped Evan secure a lucrative job in Chicago. However, future plans hung as an unspoken word between them, a mystery wrapped in silent exchanges and stolen kisses.
Unknown to Sarah, Evan planned to propose at their graduation party. Unaware of Evan's intentions, Sarah's parents accepted his invitation, thinking it was to celebrate Sarah's academic achievement. Sarah had downplayed her relationship with Evan to her parents, fearing their disappointment. 
Evan's proposal sent shock waves through Sarah. Torn between her heart's desires and her rationality, she accepted Evan's proposal. As the news sunk in, her parents retreated to their rented penthouse suite, leaving the couple amidst their friends. 
With the party over and her facade of happiness set aside, Sarah dreaded her meeting with her father. She respected him deeply and had always shared his vision until this moment. Sarah was left to face her father's disappointment and the consequences of her actions. 
Her father gave her an ultimatum - either follow Evan to Chicago and build a life there or stick to her initial plan. She had a month to decide, a month to choose between the man she loved and her dreams. 
Sarah was torn between her feelings for Evan and her promise to her father. Evan had an unshakeable bond with his sister, Liz, who lived in Chicago, and he was set to start his job soon. Sarah knew she couldn't ask Evan to uproot his life and wait for her. 
Her head said to follow her initial plan, but her heart was screaming for her to follow Evan. Against all odds, she chose her heart, stepping into an unknown yet exciting future with Evan.</Text>

Title: The Enforcers Win!
Summary: 
Patti sizes up Sarah during the game while Sarah educates herself on a game she knows nothing about. Evan and Guido's team, the Enforcers, win their game!
Setting:
Location: The aluminum bleachers at a softball field in a large recreational park in central Illinois.
Time: 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM
Weather/Environment: Partly sunny. The scene starts with a cool crisp early fall morning, but as the softball game is played and time crosses over noon, it warms up to a comfortable fall day.
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Patti)
Dialogue Focus: Moderate
Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Patti, Sarah
Secondary Characters: Evan, Roxanne, Guido
Character Emotional State:
Patti: Hurt, Stung, Jealous, Conflicted
Roxanne: Angry, Irritated, judgmental
Sarah: Oblivious that others are watching her. Focused on learning the game and was excited to see Evan play.
Plot/Action:
Beginning: With the game starting, Patti focuses on Sarah instead of the game. She watches as Sarah’s head is buried in a book, not knowing what to make of Sarah. Her internal thoughts and dialogue evaluate Sarah. Tallying the good and the bad, she notes while Sarah is pretty, she doesn’t seem very interested in the game. Her mind ponders how Sarah managed to snag Evan in record time. What about her makes her so great - Patti wondered.
Middle: 
Sarah is blissfully unaware that anyone is watching her. She continues reading her book but looks up every time it’s Evan’s turn to bat.
Roxanne has already decided that she doesn’t like Sarah. She whispers snide remarks about Sarah to Patti every chance she gets.
Patti and Roxanne mistakenly think Sarah brought a book because she is uninterested in the game. They don’t know that the book Sarah is reading is designed to help her understand a game she’s never seen before. She wants to support Evan. That’s the reason she’s reading the book. Roxanne uses the opportunity to make a derogatory comment about Sarah to Patti.
Because Sarah is out of hearing range and Roxanne is whispering, Sarah is unaware that they are talking about her.
The temperature starts to warm up at the midpoint of the game. Patti decides to get a beer and asks Sarah if she would like one. 
Not knowledgeable of concession stands at a softball game, Sarah asks if they have wine. Roxanne rolls her eyes and mumbles an insult. Patti, being a polite and kind person, gives Roxanne a scolding look and silently mouths,” Knock it off.
Patti, in an amiable tone, says to Sarah. “I don’t think they have any wine, but they may have some wine coolers. If they don’t have wine coolers, would you like something else instead? My treat!” In an appreciative tone, Sarah says no, thank you.
End: 
It’s nearing the end of the game, and Sarah has finished her book and is paying full attention to the baseball game – well, attention to Evan, anyway.
It was a tie game in the final inning, Evan was on third base, And Guido was up to bat.
Finding herself surprisingly vested in the excitement of the game, Sarah pulled out the pendant that Evan had made for her from underneath her sweatshirt and rubbed it to shed nervous energy. Patti noticed how unique the pendant was and sensed it had meaning.
Guido gets a base hit, and Evan scores the winning run.
Guido and Evan’s group of friends erupted in cheer and celebration as Evan crossed the plate for the final score.
Sarah found herself jumping up and down in excitement as well. Her enthusiasm was genuine.
While Patti usually cheered as loud as anyone, her enthusiasm was less than usual as her eyes and mind watched Sarah. Roxanne criticized Sarah as being fake.
Evan and Guido ran to the bleachers. Guido headed toward the group of friends. Evan made a B-Line straight for Sarah, picking her up, spinning her around, and ending in a passionate kiss.
A kiss that felt like another punch in the gut or slap in the face to Patti.
Guido invites everybody to a post-game celebration at a sports bar and Grille called, “Sluggers.”
With Evan and Sarah on their way to the car, outside the hearing range, she asked if Guido knew anything about the unusual pendant Sarah was rubbing at the end of the game. Guido explained the story behind the pendant and that Evan had it custom-made for their first date. This felt like a knockout punch to Patti. She had never known Evan to be creative like that and never received any sentimental gifts when they were together. 
Roxanne complains to Patti and Guido that Evan is being insensitive to pad his feelings, being so affectionate with Sarah in front of everyone. Both Guido and Patti defend Evan.
Feeling resigned/defeated,  the scene ends with Patti asking Guido. “Evan’s in love with her, isn’t he?” Guido says nothing and shrugs his shoulders, signaling he doesn’t know the answer to that question.
Objectives/Goals:
Through Patti’s eyes, we see that Sarah differs from his past relationships. And at this point in the story, no one can be sure if the relationship will last and why Evan would choose Sarah over Patti. Patti is every bit as beautiful as Sarah and far more compatible with Evan.
It is crucial to understand Patti’s conflict in this scene. In the previous school year, Patti was well aware of Evan’s unusual monogamous but casual relationship history. He never deceived her or called her his girlfriend. They were good friends before they started sleeping together. However, somewhere along the line, Patti developed strong feelings for Evan and began to feel like a girlfriend. She lasted twice as long as any other girl Evan was with, and Evan even introduced Patti to his sister – something he had never done before. However, when the school year ended, and Patti went back home for summer break, the intimate aspect of the relationship ended. When the current school year started, Evan treated her as a good friend, as though the intimate part of the relationship had never happened. She thought he would come around and be with her again, and the next thing you know, he has a girlfriend.
Props/Items:
Bleachers
Sarah’s Pendant that Evan had custom-made for her
Sarah’s book is titled, “Softball for Dummies.”
Dialogue:
Key Lines:
Patti: “I don’t think they have any wine, but they may have some wine coolers. Would you like something else instead? My treat!”
Patti: “I’m headed to the concession stand. Can I grab your beer or something to drink?”
Roxanne: “Can you fucking believe she’s reading a book at her ‘boyfriend’s’ softball game!?”
Roxanne: “What the hell is wrong with Evan? He’s so insensitive, making out with his ‘girlfriend’ in front of Patti. It pisses me off!”
Guido: “He is not being insensitive. You know Evan. He’s just oblivious to this kind of thing. He doesn’t know he’s hurting anyone. We’re all his friends. He expects us to support his choices.”
Roxanne: “That’s bullshit, Guido!”
Patti:: “It’s not bullshit. If I brought a boyfriend to the game, Evan would support me, no matter what he may or may not feel inside.”
Patti: “He’s in love with her, isn’t he?”
Tone: Curious, Somber, Wounded, Exciting, Reflective
Action Tags/Dialogue Tags:
Patti is reflective and serene during this scene, even though inside, she is hurting.
During this scene, Roxanne is animated in both face and body/arm motions. She’s angry at Evan and has negatively prejudged Sarah.
Sarah remains focused on her book for the game’s duration, except when Evan is at bat. Then she focuses on him before returning to her book when his turn at bat is over. By the end of the game, she’s a fully vested fan of Evan and the outcome of the game. Action and dialogues should reflect this as needed.
Roxanne always uses air quotes when saying ‘girlfriend’ - referring to Sarah.
Themes/Motifs:
Betrayal hurt feelings
Notes:
Sarah is oblivious to all this being said about her. Roxanne and Patti speak quietly out of Sarah’s—hearing range.
I'm not sure how much you know about baseball. I like to bring the reader into the end of the game when Evan is on third base and Guido is up to bat. Guido's base hit brings in the winning run for victory. As much as you're able, let's inject that excited energy into the scene. Let's have the reader feel like they’re on the bleachers cheering along with Patti and Sarah and the group of friends.
Summary/Synopsis:
Patti sizes up Sarah during the game while Sarah educates herself on a game she knows nothing about. Evan and Guido’s team, the Enforcers, win their game!</Text>
            <Notes>In this scene, we are mainly in Patty's head with a bit of chime-in from Roxanne. While Patti is trying to figure out where things are between Evan and Sarah, Roxanne judges Sarah every chance she can.
Although feelings stung by Sarah's presence, Patti does her best to treat Sarah well, offering to grab her a beer from the concession stand.</Notes>

            <Title>Part 5: No dating policy</Title>
            <Text>Katie's head tilted slightly, a silent question in her eyes. The puzzle of how a date came to be from a runner's flight was intriguing. Sarah's words offered the missing piece; Evan had sought her out in the library, persistent and charming. Despite her best attempts to stay true to her policy, she found herself succumbing to the magnetic pull of Evan's appeal.
A knowing smile danced on Katie's lips as she watched Sarah's face transform, a touch of red gracing her cheeks. It was evident; the rule, the policy Sarah had held on to so firmly, had been fractured. A spark of defiance lit up in her eyes, an implicit admission of breaking her no-dating policy.
Katie's features softened into a warm, knowing smile. &quot;So you decided to step beyond your no-dating policy?&quot; Her tone carried no judgment; instead, it was rich with approval, almost as if she had been waiting for Sarah to allow herself this freedom.
Sarah shrugged, a hint of sheepishness creeping into her features. &quot;I didn’t have a choice. Every time he kisses me, I can’t think straight. Since the moment I met him, I haven’t been able to study or focus on anything. All I think about is him. Maybe this date will help clear my mind.&quot;
&quot;Are you hoping this date will lead to something more?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes glinting with mischief.
&quot;I have thought a lot about that. If I could find a way to have a relationship with Evan without being distracted from my work, I would like that. The thought of having someone by my side when attending an event or someone to hang out with here at home, appeals to me. But, I have a feeling it’s not going to be that simple.&quot;
Katie nodded, taking in Sarah's words. &quot;Well, if you ask me, I think you are doing the right thing. You can't let your studies keep you from living your life. There is always a way to make things work. You just have to find your balance.&quot;</Text>

            <Title>Rick Riordan</Title>
            <Text>In the early days of their final year at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, found their paths crossing. Neither Sarah nor Evan had ever encountered each other in their previous years, despite sharing the same university campus. 
Evan was the kind of guy who effortlessly commanded attention, his charm and charisma captivating everyone around him. He was popular, yet his popularity never inflated his ego, thanks to his sister Liz's guidance. He was equally kind to everyone, whether they were the university's star quarterback or the most reclusive bookworm. His academic standing, however, was a different story. 
Evan could've been a stellar student, but he preferred the crisp outside air to a lecture room's stale atmosphere. But he had promised Liz, he'd graduate with at least a 3.0 GPA. His current GPA hovered precariously around the agreed threshold, and to keep his promise, he found himself heading to the library more often than he'd like.
Sarah, on the other hand, was an academic paragon. Graduation saw her at the top of her class, and she considered the library her sanctuary. In her usual spot, she was deeply absorbed in an audio seminar about international business techniques. So absorbed that she lost track of time and risked being late to the Business-101 class she taught once a week. With earbuds still in, Sarah hurriedly ascended the library stairs and burst out onto the university platform.
Evan, recognizing her distracted rush towards the perilous, handrail-less concrete stairs, tried to warn her, but his shouts were drowned out by the seminar still blaring in her ears. He sprinted towards her, aiming to intercept her before the stairs. 
He got there just in time, their bodies colliding in a tango-esque whirl. Their eyes met, and a kiss, fiery and passionate, followed. 
Raised with a single-minded focus on academics and groomed to take over her father's corporate empire after graduation, Sarah had always sidelined romance. Her social life was limited to the elite circles she mingled with during her volunteer work for various nonprofit organizations. Despite her stunning looks, she had minimal experience with love and romance. 
Still in shock and worry about her impending tardiness, Sarah fled, leaving Evan dazed, her name and number unknown to him.
Several days later, Evan found her. He returned the glasses she'd left in her rush, which he'd taken upon himself to repair. Evan, with his disarming charm, eventually persuaded Sarah to take a break. 
At the food court, Sarah began questioning the stark differences between them. She saw how much the other coeds adored him, how outgoing he was, so different from her introverted personality. Fearful, she excused herself and bolted for her car, only to be caught by Evan. Eventually, they agreed to a date, sealed with another passionate kiss.
With no idea what to wear for a date, having not been on one since she was 16, Sarah turned to Katie Andrews, one of her top students in her Business-101 class. With Katie and her stylist friend's help, they modernized her style, swapping glasses for contacts and adding lowlights to her golden locks.
In the salon, she contemplated the implications of breaking her vow of avoiding romance while still in college. If she was going to engage in a relationship, she was going to approach it logically, like a business negotiation.
Their first dinner was akin to a business meeting, with Sarah outlining guidelines for their relationship, emphasizing her goal to graduate at the top. Evan, smitten since their first kiss, agreed, happy to have a relationship built on clarity. One week after their chance encounter, they became an official couple.
As the relationship progressed, Sarah allowed herself to explore the uncharted territories of romance, revealing a side of her that craved affection, a side she didn't know existed until Evan.
They spent the rest of their senior year together, growing and evolving. Sarah discovered her social side while Evan improved his academics, even securing a lucrative job in Chicago thanks to Sarah.
Evan planned to propose at the graduation party, with Sarah's parents secretly invited. They believed the occasion was to celebrate Sarah's academic success. Sarah had kept her relationship with Evan casual to her parents, hiding the depth of her feelings. She feared her father's disappointment, having promised to stick to her academic goals.
Evan's proposal took Sarah by surprise. Though every rational part of her screamed rejection, she said yes. She loved Evan too much to reject him, even if it meant diverting from her planned path and following Evan to Chicago.
After Sarah accepted Evan's proposal, her parents slipped out of the party, leaving Sarah with the impending confrontation. The idea of disappointing her father, someone she respected immensely, was devastating.
After the party, she met her parents. Her father, always fair, gave her two choices: stick to her original plan and attend an Ivy League school or follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him. She had a month to decide.
Evan's bond with his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, was unshakable. She knew she couldn't ask him to abandon his new job and wait for her. She faced a clear choice: stick to her plan or build a life with Evan in Chicago.
Her brain said to follow the plan; her heart said to choose Evan. Against all odds, she followed her heart.</Text>

            <Title>Evan Meets Morgan Freeman?</Title>
            <Text>Amidst the grand chandeliers and elegant finery of the Grand Ballroom at the Grandeur Hotel, the wealthy and sophisticated attendees were mingling, cocktails in hand. The glittering throng was abuzz with talk of charitable donations, and the anticipation of a night filled with generosity was palpable.
Mere seconds into their journey, Evan's sharp eyes caught Marcus Chamberlain, Sarah's distinguished boss. Unable to resist his comic ways, he nudged her, saying, &quot;Hey Sarah, Morgan Freeman showed up!&quot;
Sarah’s eyes widened in horror. “Shh, Evan, someone might hear you. Don't look his way. We need to warm you up a bit before I introduce you.”
The playful sparkle in Evan's eyes betrayed his nerves, and he grinned. &quot;Too late. Morgan is on his way. Should I ask for his autograph?&quot;
Sarah's eyes narrowed, unamused by Evan's jokes. She immediately flashed a smile she'd been practicing since she attended her first fundraiser at 12 years old. Out of the corner of her mouth, she whispered, &quot;Be professional.&quot;
Marcus Chamberlain looked over at Sarah and Evan and began walking their way, his eyes fixed on the new face accompanying his trusted employee.
Marcus is coming over. I hope Evan does well, Sarah thought, her anxiety bubbling beneath her professional demeanor.
Marcus approached with a beaming smile, praising Sarah, &quot;Sarah, you've done a great job here. I'm very impressed!&quot;
&quot;Thank you, Mr. Chamberlain-&quot; Sarah began, only to be interrupted.
&quot;Please, not so formal. Call me Marcus,&quot; he said with a warm grin.
&quot;Thank you, Marcus, for trusting me with such a prestigious event. I am honored to be associated with your organization.&quot;
Marcus's eyes drifted to Evan, his curiosity piqued. &quot;Ah, a new face. Who have you brought with you today?&quot;
Sarah’s voice held a note of pride. &quot;This is my boyfriend, Evan.&quot;
Evan and Marcus engaged in a firm, appropriate handshake, a mutual respect exchanged in the simple gesture. &quot;Nice to meet you, Evan,&quot; Marcus said, his voice sincere.
&quot;A pleasure to meet you as well, Marcus,&quot; Evan replied, his excitement bubbling over into a charming grin.
So far, so good, Sarah thought, feeling good about how the conversation had started.
&quot;So, you're Sarah’s boyfriend?&quot; Marcus inquired, his eyes twinkling.
Evan smiled and said, &quot;My proudest accomplishment to date!&quot;
His response caused Sarah concern, but Marcus chuckled, easing the tension. &quot;Have you had a chance to look at the items up for auction?&quot;
Evan's eyes brightened. &quot;I took a quick peek on my way into the ballroom. I’d give my right arm for those Bears tickets on the 50-yard line!&quot;
Sarah's concern notched up to minor anxiety, and she glanced at Evan, trying to figure out how to silently remind him to stay focused on the nonprofit organization.
Marcus's eyes sparkled with amusement. &quot;Are you a Bears fan?&quot;
Evan's animated facial expression and exaggerated nod increased Sarah's concern and anxiety, but Marcus chuckled again. &quot;It’s a blind auction. I think bidding starts in a few minutes. Who knows, maybe you’ll have the winning bid.&quot;
Unaware that Sarah was dying of anxiety inside, Evan continued his comic ways. &quot;You see this suit? It’s nice, isn’t it?&quot; he joked, tugging on the lapels of his suit jacket.
Marcus looked a bit confused but played along. &quot;Quite nice, yes.&quot;
Evan’s next words sent Sarah's heart racing. &quot;I would love to bid on those tickets, but this suit represents the last dollar in my bank account.&quot;
Although meant to be humorous, It was also very true. 
Sarah wanted to disappear, but then something unexpected happened. Marcus cracked up at Evan's joke. &quot;Sarah, I love this guy. He's hilarious!&quot;
Sarah remained paralyzed in her smile, unsure how to respond, her mind whirling. Is this really happening?
&quot;I understand,&quot; Marcus continued, his voice filled with understanding. &quot;I was young and always short on cash back in the day. But you know our organization does great work. Would you consider donating your time? We are always in need of volunteers.&quot;
Evan's sincere response notched down Sarah's anxiety. &quot;I would love to help out! Sarah told me about the great work ‘Home Is Where the Heart Is’ does.&quot;
Sarah's was thrilled that Evan remembered the name of the organization. Marcus was equally impressed. &quot;I'm glad to hear that! Sarah can give you the details. She’s in charge of the project. Two weeks from today, we’ll be helping folks clean up what's left after a tornado hit a town not far from where Sarah lives. Do you think you can make it that Saturday?&quot;
Evan's enthusiasm was infectious. &quot;Count me in! I'm sure I can recruit a handful of friends to help volunteer as well.&quot;
Sarah finally found her voice, her anxiety decreased, excitement replacing it. &quot;Really? Who do you think will come?&quot;
Evan's playful humor returned as he considered. &quot;Patti is a lock! This is right up her alley, and wherever Patti goes, Roxanne goes. I'm sure I can get Guido to commit, and I think I could convince three or four more friends to help out.&quot;
Sarah's surprise was evident. &quot;Guido? I wouldn’t think he’d be interested in volunteering.&quot;
Evan looked at Marcus, half serious, half joking. &quot;Will there be single adult females volunteering?&quot;
Marcus saw where Evan was going and played along. &quot;I'm sure there will be plenty.&quot;
&quot;That's a great incentive. We'll add a six-pack of beer for a job well done, and Guido will be in!&quot; Evan declared, his eyes twinkling.
Sarah wanted to crawl under a rock, certain that talk of single females and 6-packs of beer were not appropriate things to say to Marcus. But as before, Marcus laughed even louder than he had before. &quot;I can't wait to meet this Guido fella.&quot;
Evan comically rolled his eyes. &quot;Believe me, you can wait.&quot;
Both men flowed in laughter, and Sarah's anxiety began to ease. Marcus then inquired about the auction, and with an unexpected generosity, offered the Bears tickets to Evan if he could recruit his friends to volunteer.
Evan's shock and gratitude were evident. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; he asked, his voice filled with disbelief.
&quot;I'm positive,&quot; Marcus assured him. &quot;A handful of young volunteers is worth much more than we'll get at auction for those tickets.&quot;
Marcus turned to Sarah. &quot;Can you pull the Bears tickets off the auction table?&quot;
Sarah's mind was a whirlwind, but she managed to stammer, &quot;I'll go get them right now.&quot;
Marcus called out to her just as she started walking away. &quot;Sarah, those are valuable tickets. Put them somewhere safe.&quot;
Sarah turned to Marcus and nodded confirmation, her eyes wide with understanding.
Marcus then continued to answer Evan’s question, his eyes twinkling with amusement. &quot;Decent quarterback? The Bears? Probably in the year 2000 never?&quot;
Both men laughed, their voices ringing through the grand ballroom. Other men started joining the conversation, talking about the Bear's quarterback woes and other sports-related topics, adding to the jovial atmosphere.
As Sarah left, their voices faded into the background, the sound of camaraderie and good-natured banter lingering in her ears. Her mind spun as she processed the unexpected connection between Evan and Marcus, two people she had never expected to bond so quickly. Surprised, even shocked, she found herself unable to shake her confusion as she made her way across the room.
What just happened? she wondered, the question echoing in her mind as she continued to move, her steps automatic. The evening had taken an unexpected turn, leaving her feeling both bewildered and oddly reassured.</Text>

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                   Part One

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font
used by their house. This PDF file was generated using
Scrivener's compile feature and was created using the &quot;Novel&quot;
project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-
caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

                                                 Chapter Two

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character
during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                   Part Two

                                               Chapter Three

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert the word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt;
Insert &gt; Draft Word Count. (For a manuscript, you may wish to
have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case
select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest
100--this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript,
in fact.)


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In
reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Synopsis>On the drive to the restaurant for a celebratory post-game party, Evan and Sarah discuss her inaugural experience attending a softball game and how things went with Evan's friends. Sarah shares her insecurities about attending the party.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah and Evan climbed into her freshly waxed, pearl-white luxury sedan, still flush with excitement from the game. The exterior gleamed in the partly sunny weather, reflecting their victorious mood as they buckled in for the drive to Sluggers sports bar and grill.
&quot;So, how was it, experiencing your first softball game?&quot; Evan asked, his eyes twinkling with curiosity.
&quot;It was fun! Especially at the end. I loved watching you score the winning run!&quot; Sarah replied, her fingers finding Evan's pendant around her neck.
Evan laughed affectionately, noticing her gesture. &quot;So you enjoyed the game?&quot;
&quot;Honestly, I'll probably never be a huge fan. But I enjoyed watching you play,&quot; Sarah admitted, smiling at Evan.
Evan smiled. &quot;I can live with that.”
&quot;I absolutely adore my pendant, Evan!&quot; Sarah exclaimed, her eyes shining as she looked down at the cherished gift, her fingers tenderly tracing its contours. &quot;I can't explain it, but it feels like a security blanket for me. Like a part of you that's always with me.&quot;
Evan's face broke into a beaming smile, his heart swelling with joy at her attachment to his gift. He reached over and cupped her face, his eyes mirroring her excitement. &quot;That's exactly what I hoped it would be for you! I'm thrilled you love it so much.&quot;
They continued their conversation, with Evan inquiring about her time with his friends and Sarah sharing her mixed emotions. Her nervousness grew as they rode nearer to the bar, and Evan did his best to comfort her.
Sarah pulled into the parking lot of Sluggers, a sudden, all-consuming terror engulfing her from the inside out. On the surface, she maintained her composure, her face betraying nothing of the turmoil raging within. But inside, a storm was brewing.
I've never been anyone's girlfriend before, she thought, her heart pounding in her chest. What if I mess this up? What if his friends hate me? What if I don't fit into Evan's world?
The fear was visceral, unlike anything she'd ever felt before. It clawed at her insides, threatening to consume her whole. Her hand went to the pendant again, seeking comfort in its soothing touch, but even that couldn't quell the rising panic.
Evan glanced at her, sensing something amiss but not grasping the full extent of her terror. &quot;You'll be fine,&quot; he said, squeezing her hand. &quot;But if you're not ready, let's go somewhere else.&quot;
His words were meant to reassure, but they only heightened her anxiety. The weight of her new role, the uncertainty, the fear of the unknown--it was all too much, all at once. She forced a smile, willing herself to be brave, even as a voice in the back of her mind screamed in protest.
&quot;No,&quot; she said, determination lacing her voice. &quot;It will make things worse if you don't show up after scoring the winning run. They'll know I caused you to be a no-show at the party. I'll be okay.&quot;
But as she stepped out of the car, her legs felt like jelly and a cold sweat broke out on her skin. This was a new world, and she was stepping into it alone, armed only with her feelings for Evan while paralyzed with the fear of looking like a fool.
The pendant lay against her skin, a physical reminder of Evan's affection, but even that couldn't silence the nagging doubt that gnawed at her soul. She was on the brink of something new, something terrifying, and there was no turning back.
In that moment, she knew she was facing a fear like never before, a challenge that cut to the core of her identity. But she also knew that she had to face it for Evan, for herself, and for their relationship.
With one last look at the luxury sedan, she closed the door on the safety and comfort it represented, stepping into the unknown, her heart both heavy with trepidation and alive with hope.</Text>
            <Notes>At some point her pendant is a security blanket.
&quot;Evan, I'm nervous about the post-game party and hanging out with your friends in general. I'm so different than them. Besides Patti, I don't think they liked me very much,&quot; Sarah confessed.
&quot;Give it time. They'll warm up to you soon enough,&quot; Evan assured her, his voice filled with understanding.
As they pulled into the Sluggers parking lot, a terrified feeling engulfed Sarah. Her grip on the steering wheel tightened, and her inner nerves started to escape outwardly.
&quot;I am starting to freak out. I don't know if I can do this. I don't think I'm ready yet,&quot; she stammered.
&quot;You'll be fine. But if you're not ready, let's go somewhere else,&quot; Evan suggested, his voice gentle.
&quot;I've never been anyone's girlfriend before. I don't want to suck at it,&quot; Sarah blurted, tears in her eyes.
Evan laughed, reaching over to hold her hand. &quot;You don't and won't suck at it. Come on, let's go somewhere else.&quot;
&quot;No. They'll know I caused you to be a no-show at the party. I'll be okay,&quot; Sarah insisted, determination in her voice.

            <Synopsis>Sarah's resistance weakens further as she agrees to go on a date with Evan later in the week.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah's feet were brisk against the sidewalk, the rhythm of her steps resonating with the morning's hurried energy. Yet, her speed wasn't enough. She heard Evan's voice calling out behind her, his tone playfully admonishing, &quot;Hey, Cinderella, wait up!&quot;
She halted in her tracks, her heart thrumming in her chest. Turning back, she faced him, a bewildered expression etched on her face. &quot;Why do you call me Cinderella?&quot;
Evan's easy smile danced in the sunlight, as though he were a character plucked straight from a charming romance novel. His eyes, bright with humor, crinkled at the corners. &quot;Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”
“And why are you so adamant about chasing after me?&quot; She countered, a defiant edge lacing her words. &quot;It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.&quot;
Caught in the gravity of his gaze, Sarah noted the determination etched in his features. &quot;I want to learn more about you,&quot; Evan stated simply, standing tall in his conviction. &quot;What’s wrong with that?”
Sarah huffed, her chest rising and falling with the rhythm of her disbelief. &quot;It doesn’t take a genius to see that we exist in different worlds.”
His laughter, unexpected and genuine, echoed around them. “Let me guess. You’re a genius?”
“That’s not my point.”
The tranquility of Evan's demeanor was compelling. His gaze was patient and unwavering as he prompted, “Then what is your point?”
“As a couple, we make little sense. I came to college to get an education and network with professionals to further my academic and professional careers. I committed to focusing on my work and refraining from distracting relationships. You don’t need me. You must know every female on campus.”
Evan smiled, his grin a heartrending blend of sincerity and charm. “Are you jealous? You have nothing to worry about.”
&quot;I’m not jealous. I simply can’t understand why you’re focusing your attention on me,&quot; Sarah replied, her arms crossed over her chest, a physical barrier to the emotions threatening to spill over. Her eyes, brimming with questions, searched his.
Evan looked at her, his gaze reflecting a mix of curiosity and genuine interest. &quot;Maybe the universe meant for us to meet! I don't know, Sarah. There's just something about you. You're different from the girls I'm used to meeting.&quot;
&quot;You don't even know me,&quot; she countered, her voice softer than intended, her gaze shifting to the ground, avoiding his penetrating stare.
He nodded, acknowledging her point. &quot;That's true,&quot; he admitted, a breeze lifting a lock of his hair as he met her gaze again. &quot;But let me ask you something. Why did you kiss me? Why are you here with me now instead of studying?&quot;
Her response was a mere whisper, lost amidst the symphony of the campus sounds around them. She shifted on her feet, her foot tracing an absent pattern on the pavement. &quot;Other than the obvious…&quot; she began, implying Evan's good looks. Her voice tapered off to a whisper, &quot;I don't know either.&quot;
A persuasive plea was etched in Evan's eyes as he stepped closer to her, the distance between them shrinking to a mere breath. &quot;Well, let's find out together,&quot; he said earnestly, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Go to dinner with me.”
Silence enveloped them, the sounds of the bustling campus fading into a distant hum. Evan waited for her answer, each second stretching into an eternity. Finally, when the silence had stretched too long, Evan added, “College is about relationships, having fun, trying new things.”
Sarah resisted, but the inner argument she was having with herself was evident in the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes. &quot;I made a plan that makes sense, and I’ve held to it for three years.”
“Doesn’t it make sense to enjoy your college life? To be well-rounded? To pursue new relationships?” Evan countered.
Sarah was exasperated. She wasn’t used to someone challenging her perspective so effectively. “You’ve got my head spinning. It doesn’t help that every time you kiss me, my IQ drops 50 points. How can my plan make so much sense, yet your opposite approach makes sense too?”
His next words caught her off guard. &quot;How can a piece of paper be both thin and wide?”
Before she could formulate an answer, Evan leaned in to kiss her again. The taste of his kiss was sweet and confusing, a turmoil of emotions, leaving her breathless. Pulling back, Evan proposed again. “Thursday night, dinner at seven at the Thai Garden?&quot;
After a moment of hesitance, she relented. &quot;Alright, I’ll meet you there at seven.”
Evan's joy was infectious as he clapped his hands together. “That’s awesome! Can I get your phone number? Your last name?”
&quot;Let’s wait and see how it goes,&quot; Sarah replied cautiously.
He nodded, accepting her boundaries. As she turned to leave, he extended his hand. “May I walk you to your car?”
The walk was silent, their hands intertwined, a silent promise of what was to come. When they reached her car, Evan leaned in, hopeful. “May I get a kiss goodbye?”
“Of course.” She answered, her breath steadier now.
The kiss was long and tender, filled with promises of the potential for something more. Pulling away, Evan teased, “How’s that IQ doing?”
Sarah responded with an unusual attempt at humor. “2+2 equals 10.”
Laughter filled the air, a comforting and intimate sound. When it finally faded, Evan's eyes held a hint of concern. “I’m afraid to let you go. I’m worried you won’t show up on Thursday.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. I never break an appointment unless it’s an emergency.” Sarah's voice was steady, and Evan could see the resolve in her eyes, a promise of the adventure to come.</Text>

            <Title>Danielle Steele</Title>
            <Text>In the picturesque landscape of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, two worlds are destined to collide. Sarah Wilkins, an intellectual luminary, and Evan Vaughn, an endearing athlete, both seniors, are entering their first semester. Their paths have never crossed until one fateful encounter at the undergrad library changes everything. 
Evan, possessing a magnetic charisma, is the golden boy of the campus, charming all who cross his path. But his appeal isn't a matter of choice; rather, it's the natural outcome of his outgoing personality, fostered by his wise and nurturing sister, Liz. Despite his popularity, Evan is not without flaws. His academic performance leaves room for improvement, and he has made a promise to Liz to graduate with at least a 3.0 GPA. As his senior year commences, he trades his beloved Frisbee games for hours of focused study, keeping Liz's promise foremost in his mind.
Sarah, on the other hand, is the epitome of academic brilliance. An ambitious business major, she finds solace in the silence of the library, her ears filled with audio seminars on international business strategies. Time slips away unnoticed in these moments, and one day, she finds herself on the brink of being late to a class she teaches. In a rush, she charges toward the library exit, oblivious to the imminent danger of a flight of stairs devoid of a handrail.
Evan, noticing the potential accident, tries to warn Sarah, but his shouts fall on her earbud-filled ears. With no time to spare, he rushes forward, just in time to catch her before she stumbles. This dramatic save culminates in an impulsive, intense kiss, awakening unexplored feelings in both of them.
Sarah, however, has been reared with a staunch academic focus and ambition to succeed her father at the helm of his multi-million-dollar corporation. The sudden blush of romance with Evan unsettles her. She has, until now, shunned any romantic entanglements, focusing on her academic aspirations.
Despite the confusion, Sarah is irresistibly drawn to Evan. He manages to track her down, returning the glasses she had left behind and charming her into a break at the food court. They embark on a whirlwind romance, with Sarah setting rules and expectations to safeguard her academic priorities. Evan, already enamored by Sarah, gladly agrees to her terms.
The ensuing year is a transformative one. Sarah learns to navigate social circles, and Evan, under Sarah's influence, improves academically. Yet, with graduation looming, Sarah is torn between her commitment to her father and the pull of her heart toward Evan.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan is planning a marriage proposal. On the day of their graduation party, amidst friends and a surprise visit from her parents, Evan pops the question. Sarah, who has underplayed the intensity of their relationship to her parents, is taken aback. 
Her father, a man of stoic but fair character, presents her with a choice - to follow her heart to Chicago with Evan, risking financial support, or to adhere to her initial plan of pursuing her Master's degree and joining her father's corporation. Torn between her mind and her heart, Sarah is faced with a daunting decision.
In the style of Danielle Steel, this story unfolds with high emotion and heart-stirring choices. Against all odds, Sarah's heart emerges victorious, choosing a life with Evan in Chicago over her original plan.</Text>
            <Notes>Style: Danielle Steele. Danielle Steele's novels often involve internal conflict, complicated relationships, and a detailed focus on the protagonist's thoughts and emotions. The dialogue is simple, and there's an undercurrent of romance and hope. Her writing style is also noted for its detailed descriptions, emotionality, and dramatic storytelling. 

[This scene is written in the style of Danielle Steele, with her signature blend of romantic turmoil and emotional upheaval, played out against the backdrop of everyday life.] </Notes>

Employing his charm, he persuades Sarah to take a break, and they head to the campus food court, initiating a newfound connection between the two.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: Evan is a Man With a Plan
Summary: Evan, undeterred, revisits the scene of the kiss in search of Sarah. Following a hunch, he heads to the library to find Sarah.
Characters: Evan
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Time of Day: Morning
Locations: In the car, driving to campus.
Tone: Optimistic, hopeful
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions:
Do not refer to Evan as &quot;penny-pinching.&quot; Stay away from synonyms of that as well. For example, don't use the word frugal when describing Evan. 
Evan was in the car alone. There are no other characters in this scene.
Sequence of Events:
The scene starts with Evan driving to campus in his old but reliable vehicle – a Subaru small SUV with over a hundred thousand miles, about what you'd expect for a financially struggling college student.
The weather was perfect like it was the day he and Sarah met.
He was playing an energetic song on the radio. The Cubs were on a three-game winning streak. His team won their Sunday softball game. Life was Good.
Guido successfully talked Evan out of hours of Internet searching, seeking his mystery girl. 
Guido also convinced Evan what a sorry sight he was sitting in the rain waiting for a woman that would never show. And even if she did, she might find the site of a desperate man unappealing.
This morning, Evan woke up with an inspired idea. He was sure it would meet with success. It was like the Universe planted this thought seed in his mind overnight. He couldn't believe he didn't think of it before.
Upon waking up, he remembered how Sarah was dressed like a professor.  He speculated, &quot;She is probably a bookworm. Where do I find a bookworm? The library. Duh!&quot;
This revelation injected an air of confidence in Evan.
When he got to campus, he was going to the spot of their first kiss. If she weren’t there, he wouldn’t wait futilely outside. Instead, he would head down into the undergrad library – where he was certain he would find her.
This scene is primarily a setup scene for the next scene he appears in and finds Sarah in the library as expected. The scene should end with Evan closing his car door, taking a deep breath of the early fall air, and confidently heading to the library. He is excited but not anxious. I want the reader to feel confident along with Evan.

            <Title>0121 Evan Calls Liz for Advice</Title>
            <Synopsis>Disappointed he has been unable to find Sarah after their kiss, Evan calls his sister, Liz, for advice.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan’s alarm blared for the third time that morning. It was already 11 AM, and he had snoozed the alarm repeatedly. On a typical Saturday, he would be up by 8 o'clock for a morning jog and workout. But today was different. A shadow of disappointment hung heavily over him; he hadn't found Sarah since their kiss two days ago. Even a Friday night Cubs’ victory couldn't lift his spirits. Feeling helpless, he'd earlier asked Guido to cover his client training sessions for the afternoon.
With a sigh, Evan finally pushed himself out of bed, feeling the weight of desperation settle on him. He needed advice, guidance. He needed the reassuring voice of the person who was always there for him—his sister, Liz. Grabbing his phone, he dialed her number and waited, his heart thumping in his chest.
&quot;Hello?&quot; Liz's voice crackled from the other end, and she pretended she didn't know who the caller was, adding a touch of humor to her tone.
&quot;Hey, Liz, do you have a few minutes to talk?&quot; Evan asked, feeling the relief of hearing his sister’s  voice.
&quot;I'm sorry, who is this?&quot; she continued to tease.
&quot;Um, it's Evan.&quot;
&quot;Hmm, that name doesn't ring a bell.&quot;
Evan couldn't help but smile, despite his downer mood. &quot;Quit teasing. It's Evan Vaughn, your brother.&quot;
&quot;Oh, now I remember. It's been forever since I've heard from my little brother.&quot;
&quot;It's only been a couple of weeks.&quot;
&quot;Six weeks, to be exact. What's up? Are you feeling okay? Are you still having those energy drop issues?&quot; 
Evan felt a twinge of irritation at the question. In the last year or two, he had periods where his energy dropped significantly, sometimes lasting for a couple of hours, sometimes a couple of days. A concerned Liz often asked about his health, causing him to feel like she was nagging him.
&quot;No, I haven't had any problems,&quot; Evan deflected.
&quot;I wish you would go to the doctor and get checked out.&quot;
&quot;You know how I feel about most doctors. They get kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies. They're chomping at the bit to prescribe drugs when most of the time, all that is needed is proper diet and exercise.&quot;
&quot;You and your fear of doctors. I'll never understand.&quot;
&quot;I've seen more than one friend or family get addicted to prescribed painkillers and antidepressants. You've seen it too.&quot;
&quot;I'm asking you to go to the doctor, not get addicted to painkillers.&quot;
&quot;I'm fine, Liz. Please stop worrying. We have to get a physical every six months for work, and I just got mine a few weeks ago. I got a clean bill of health.&quot;
&quot;I would've known that if you had called me,&quot; Liz said, her voice tinged with teasing. Liz and Evan never fought or got angry with each other, but they did like to tease each other.
&quot;I'm sorry, I've been busy with school and work –&quot;
Interrupting, Liz added, “And sports and parties and girls.” 
Evan laughed at his sister’s accuracy. 
&quot;That's what I called to talk about, girls. Well, one girl in particular. I think she's the one.&quot;
Liz’s ears perked up. “The one? Do tell.”
&quot;I literally bumped into her on the way to the library. She was in a rush and headed for a hard fall. I was lucky enough to get there in the knick of time before she hit the ground. Next thing I know, we’re kissing. Oh my God, Liz. It was the best kiss of my life.&quot;
&quot;What a wonderful way to meet! Tell me more about her.&quot;
&quot;That's the thing, Liz; I know nothing about her. She ran away without so much as giving me her name.&quot;
&quot;Why do you think she ran away? Was she upset you kissed her?&quot;
&quot;No, Liz, you taught me always to be respectful. In the heat of the moment, I told her I wanted to kiss her. And she said I could. So I did!&quot;
&quot;I'm proud of you for being respectful. But then, why did she run?&quot;
&quot;I wish I knew. Guido thinks she has a boyfriend, but I said no way that's true. I think she ran because she was late for class. At least, I hope that was the reason. I waited for her to return, but she never showed. I returned the next day, and still, she didn't show.&quot;
&quot;I wouldn't worry too much. You know what I always say.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I know. If it's meant to be, it will be,&quot; Evan said, his voice infused with the mild annoyance of having heard the phrase a million times before.
&quot;But Liz, there is something special about this girl. I am desperate to find her. I know it's too soon to be sure, but I feel she's the one for me.&quot;
&quot;I know it's hard to be patient. But I'm telling you, Evan, the harder you look, the less likely that you'll find her. When you stop looking, she'll appear. That's just how these things work.&quot;
&quot;Guido said as much. He said I looked pathetic getting soaked, waiting for her in the rain, and then spending hours online last night desperately trying to find her with no luck.&quot;
&quot;I wish I were there to give you a hug. You're not pathetic for enthusiastically seeking love. But Guido is right to some extent; go back to enjoying life. You put in the effort to find her, and that's a good thing, a great thing. But it's not healthy to become obsessive in your pursuits.&quot;
&quot;I know you're right. I want to meet her again. I never wanted anything as much in my life.&quot;
&quot;Do you really think she may be the one?&quot;
&quot;I don't think it; I know it!&quot;
&quot;Then carry that confidence with you until you find her. If it's meant to be, you will find her!&quot; Liz said, her tone empowering and confident.
Liz's words pumped up Evan, infusing him with renewed hope and energy. &quot;You're right! I'm not gonna be pathetic, desperately seeking Sarah. We are meant to be, and the universe will bring her to me again.&quot;
&quot;Now that's the Evan I know! I know you're going to find her. I've never heard you call any girl 'the one.' And I'm especially impressed you met her on the way to the library!&quot; They both laughed at the library comment.
&quot;That just proves how awesome my sister is. I never would've met her if you didn't make me promise to keep my grades up.&quot;
&quot;I can't take the credit. But now that you mention it, are you keeping your grades up?&quot; Liz teased.
Teasingly, Evan changed the subject without answering her. &quot;No time to talk, Liz; gotta get ready for work.&quot; Liz laughed at Evan's evasive response.
&quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll call you. Gotta run; love you, sis!&quot;
&quot;I love you too.&quot;
He hung up the phone, his heart lighter, his spirit renewed. A rejuvenated Evan Evan texted Guido, letting him know that he didn't need him to cover his client sessions. He felt great, and he knew, deep in his soul, that he would find Sarah again.</Text>

Yes, they said it's not that didn't see anything, probably nothing, but they offered to run a whole battery of tests.
Reader finds out that Evan is not going to tell her anymore. 
You know how I feel about hospitals and doctors. They'll just looking for reasons to put me on some medication o don't need to get their kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies.

Scene Name: Sarah and Katie Chat
Summary: Sarah and Katie engage in a heart-to-heart conversation. Katie learns more about Sarah's background, her aspirations, and her burgeoning relationship with Evan. Their chat deepens their friendship and provides Katie with insight into Sarah's world.
Characters: Sarah, Katie
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Sarah’s Apartment
Tone: Exciting, hopeful, anticipatory, friendly
Weather: Partly cloudy and nice outside.
Special Instructions: 
Evaluate the scene and check for grammar, displaying your observations in a bulleted list.
Draft Scene:
&quot;Wow, this place is amazing! How many bedrooms are there?&quot; The question resonated in the expansive space.
&quot;Two.&quot; Sarah's response came as a quiet murmur.
&quot;Is your roommate home?&quot; Katie inquired, her visual exploration of the apartment ongoing.
Sarah negated with a shake of her head. &quot;It’s just me. My father insisted I have an extra bedroom that I could use as an office. But I never use the guest room, I prefer to  work at the dining room table where I can spread out, or in my bedroom before I go to sleep.&quot;
The idea of privacy, the luxury of space, left Katie yearning. &quot;I can’t even imagine what it’s like not to share a room. Living in a tiny dorm room with a chatty roommate, makes it impossible to study.&quot;
An understanding hovered between them, thick and unspoken. As Katie's gaze made another sweep across the grand expanse of the apartment, Sarah seized the moment. With the effusive warmth of a mother granting her child a long-cherished wish, she said, &quot;You know, the guest room's always open if you ever need a quiet study sanctuary!&quot;
&quot;Really! Thank you!&quot; With those words, Katie lunged forward and gave Sarah a big hug. Sarah was taken by surprise, her glass of wine tilting precariously, the liquid inside nearly sloshing out onto her hand. But she quickly righted the glass and returned Katie's embrace, welcoming the warmth of her gratitude.
As Katie was about to open her mouth to dive into another subject, the familiar buzz of her cell phone diverted her attention. She quickly glanced at the screen, her eyebrows arching slightly. &quot;Oh, it's Nicole, my hairstylist,&quot; she explained. &quot;She wants to confirm our appointment and she needs a picture of you to start making a plan for your makeover.&quot;
Sarah blinked in surprise but then smiled in response. &quot;Alright, let's do it.&quot;
Katie quickly captured a picture of Sarah, her fingers flying over the phone as she sent the image to Nicole. Within moments, Nicole responded with a flurry of excited emojis, already expressing her eagerness to work on Sarah's transformation. 
Katie asked, &quot;So altogether, including new clothes and hairstylist, what kind of budget are we talking?&quot; 
&quot;No budget constraints, you're in charge!&quot; Sarah said with a playful grin.
Katie's eyes lit up at this and she squealed, clapping her hands in excitement. &quot;Really? Oh, this is going to be so much fun!&quot;
The energy in the room was effervescent, reflecting off Sarah as her own excitement began to bubble up. It was new, this anticipation of a date, of being made over, of possibly breaking her own rules, but it was an invigorating feeling that Sarah welcomed.

Katie, full of curiosity, veered the conversation towards Sarah's dating past. &quot;You said it had been a while since you dated?&quot; She was already conjuring up different makeovers in her mind, ready to transform Sarah for her date.
Sarah admitted, a hint of wistfulness in her voice. 'I haven’t dated since I was 16.'&quot;
&quot;16? Wowza!&quot; Katie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. But she wasn't done probing, her next question laced with a touch of delicacy. &quot;If you don’t mind me asking, are you a...&quot; She paused, &quot;virgin?&quot;
&quot;No, I’m not a virgin,&quot; Sarah confessed, the hesitation barely noticeable. &quot;I experimented for a short time in high school, but I didn't see what was so great about it.&quot;
Katie leaned in closer, her voice a comforting whisper. &quot;It will be way different when you find the right guy.” 
A mischievous twinkle lit up in Sarah's eyes, an expression that silently echoed, &quot;Maybe!?&quot; This was a different Sarah, one who was open to the possibility of something more, something exciting, something like... Evan.
Seizing the moment, Katie ventured to ask, &quot;Do you think the guy you’re meeting tonight–“
Sarah interrupted, &quot;Evan.&quot; 
Katie continued, &quot;Evan, may be the right guy?&quot;
The response was immediate, Sarah's smile reaching her eyes as she raised her eyebrows. &quot;He's the right guy if he makes love even half as good as he kisses!&quot; 
Their giggles echoed around the room, the atmosphere brimming with anticipation and the sheer joy of newfound possibilities. The girls were truly ready for a night that promised to be a roller coaster of emotions and revelations.
Katie's head tilted slightly, a silent question in her eyes. The puzzle of how a date came to be from a runner's flight was intriguing. Sarah's words offered the missing piece; Evan had sought her out in the library, persistent and charming. Despite her best attempts to stay true to her policy, she found herself succumbing to the magnetic pull of Evan's appeal.
A knowing smile danced on Katie's lips as she watched Sarah's face transform, a touch of red gracing her cheeks. It was evident; the rule, the policy Sarah had held on to so firmly, had been fractured. A spark of defiance lit up in her eyes, an implicit admission of breaking her no-dating policy.
Katie's features softened into a warm, knowing smile. &quot;So you decided to step beyond your no-dating policy?&quot; Her tone carried no judgment; instead, it was rich with approval, almost as if she had been waiting for Sarah to allow herself this freedom.
Sarah shrugged, a hint of sheepishness creeping into her features. &quot;I didn’t have a choice. Every time he kisses me, I can’t think straight. Since the moment I met him, I haven’t been able to study or focus on anything. All I think about is him. Maybe this date will help clear my mind.&quot;
&quot;Are you hoping this date will lead to something more?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes glinting with mischief.
&quot;I have thought a lot about that. If I could find a way to have a relationship with Evan without being distracted from my work, I would like that. The thought of having someone by my side when attending an event or someone to hang out with here at home, appeals to me. But, I have a feeling it’s not going to be that simple.&quot;
Katie nodded, taking in Sarah's words. &quot;Well, if you ask me, I think you are doing the right thing. You can't let your studies keep you from living your life. There is always a way to make things work. You just have to find your balance.&quot;
Katie said, &quot;We need to get going. Let's get you changed into something more fun for our shopping trip. Can we look at your wardrobe? I want to see if there's anything we can use for tonight.”</Text>

            <Title>0227 Sarah Preps Evan</Title>
            <Text>Evan couldn't help but admire Sarah as she approached, her vibrant turquoise evening gown shimmering in the ballroom's light. The fitted bodice with its modest sweetheart neckline adorned with intricate lace highlighted her grace and elegance, and the gentle train added a touch of sophistication.
&quot;You look amazing, Sarah,&quot; he said, his voice filled with genuine admiration.
Sarah's eyes widened, taking in Evan's well-fitted charcoal gray suit, soft blue dress shirt, and stylish maroon tie. &quot;And you, Evan, look like you were born to wear that suit.&quot; The outfit, though purchased on a budget, gave Evan a refined appearance, suitable for the elegant fundraiser event. It was a visual testament to his effort to fit into her world.
After Evan and Sarah exchanged compliments, she grabbed her glass of wine from the bar. &quot;Come on, Evan. Let's go talk somewhere privately,&quot; she said, her voice filled with a mix of excitement and concern.
Evan's eyebrows shot up in intrigue, but he obediently followed her. They wove through the crowd, past the coat check room, and into a small storage room. The door clicked shut behind them, creating an intimate space filled with the scent of freshly laundered linens.
&quot;Is this the make-out room?&quot; he asked, his voice brimming with the energy of a teenager in love. He leaned in for a kiss, his eyes twinkling.
Sarah's laugh was soft and alluring, but her tone was firm. &quot;Not here. This is my work. We have to keep it professional.&quot; Her eyes were serious but playful, and Evan couldn't help but be captivated by her dedication.
Evan leaned back, his lips curving into a teasing smile. &quot;Why are we whispering? There's no one here.&quot;
&quot;I have no idea.&quot; Sarah laughed again, her anxiety momentarily forgotten. The sound was like a melody to Evan's ears, and they both laughed, the tension easing.
Finally, Sarah's expression shifted to one of focus and purpose. &quot;I brought you back here because I wanted to prep you for the fundraiser. I should've done this earlier, but I got so busy.&quot;
&quot;Prep away!&quot; Evan's enthusiasm was infectious, his eyes bright with curiosity.
Sarah took a moment, her eyes searching his, her voice soft with concern. &quot;Well, first, tell me how you're feeling. Are you nervous?&quot;
Evan's response was genuine and thoughtful, his nerves laid bare. &quot;I was extremely nervous when I left my apartment. I decided to call Liz on the two-hour drive to Chicago. She reminded me that no matter how wealthy or sophisticated a person is, they still put on their pants one leg at a time. They still sneeze, burp, cough, cry, and laugh. She also told me that, most importantly, rich or poor, the best people prioritize authenticity. If they don't like me for who I am, then I should simply, as Liz calls it, 'exit gracefully.'&quot;
&quot;And that's all it took to calm your nerves?&quot; Sarah's voice was tinged with amusement, but her eyes were gentle, filled with understanding.
Evan's face split into a grin, ever the comic. &quot;Well, that and a little help from my friend Jack Daniels that your bartender introduced me to.&quot;
They both laughed again, the room filled with the sound of their shared joy. Then Sarah's face turned serious, her business look taking over. &quot;This fundraising event is for the nonprofit organization, 'Home Is Where the Heart Is.' It was founded by a very wealthy businessman and gentleman named Marcus Chamberlain – think Morgan Freeman's twin brother.&quot;
&quot;Gotcha!&quot; Evan's response was immediate, his mind working quickly to absorb the information.
&quot;This is the third event I've organized for him. I like working for him because he's not a jerk and gives me the autonomy to do the job right. He is quite distinguished, so be on your best behavior around him.&quot; Sarah's words were filled with a mix of pride and caution, her faith in Evan evident but tinged with a hint of anxiety.
Evan, ever attentive, repeated the critical components of words to help him remember. &quot;Marcus Chamberlain, Home Is Where the Heart Is, best behavior. Got it!&quot;
&quot;What will the funds raised tonight be used for?&quot; His question was genuine, his interest in the cause clear in his eyes.
Sarah's answer was filled with passion, her belief in the cause shining through. &quot;Home Is Where the Heart Is provides funds and volunteers to help low-income families rehab homes in disrepair. They also help rebuild uninsured or underinsured homes lost due to fire or natural disaster.&quot;
&quot;Wow! Those are good causes.&quot; Evan's admiration was evident, his respect for Sarah's work growing by the moment.
&quot;Yes, it is. I hope to top last year's record for this annual fundraising event.&quot; Sarah's determination was palpable, her desire to succeed burning brightly.
&quot;Who else do I need to know about? The bartender said I may have to defend you against some salacious wolves?&quot; Evan's words were accompanied by a humorously exaggerated boxer's pose, his dukes held high.
Sarah's laughter rang out again, her delight in Evan's antics clear. &quot;Just having you by my side will spook them away. It will be nice not to have to deal with them for once.&quot;
She looked at her watch, her face falling slightly. &quot;We're out of time. Look, do your best. Don't be offended or surprised if a bunch of people try to get you to donate money. Since no one knows you, they may think you're a trust fund kid and see you as fresh meat.&quot;
Evan's face turned mock-serious, his eyes twinkling. &quot;Can I get a kiss before we head out into the den of wolves?&quot;
Evan found it amusing when his request for a quick kiss was met with a brief, paranoid glance around the room. He didn't understand her caution, but her endearing paranoia brought a smile to his face.
&quot;Alright, one quick kiss, that's it.&quot; Sarah's words were firm, but her eyes were soft.
True to her word, Evan got a quick kiss, and that was it.
Sarah opened the door, peeked her head out, and looked both ways. With the coast clear, she and Evan walked down the hall toward The Grand Ballroom.
As they reached the edge of the grand ballroom, illuminated by the soft glow of crystal chandeliers and filled with the murmur of elegant conversations, Evan turned to Sarah with an air of traditional gallantry. His eyes met hers, and with a slight, gentlemanly bow, he extended his arm toward her. Understanding the timeless gesture, Sarah gracefully slipped her arm into his, allowing her hand to rest just above his elbow. With arms interlocked, they ventured into the mystery of the evening ahead, both excited and optimistic about what lay before them.

Please review the scene details and rewrite at your discretion.
Food Court Description:
The food court at the University of Illinois is a bustling hub of activity, brimming with the sounds of students engaging in lively conversation, the clatter of trays and dishes, and the aromas of a myriad of different cuisines. The spacious place has high ceilings and a skylight allowing natural light during the day. In the evening, the area is illuminated by an assortment of warm, overhead lights.
Multiple food stalls line the perimeter, offering an international array of food options. From quick bites like burgers and pizzas to various Asian cuisines, Italian pasta dishes, and Mexican delights, the diversity is impressive. There's also a salad bar for those preferring healthier options and an irresistible dessert station filled with sweet treats.
In the center of the food court is a large seating area filled with a mix of chairs, booths, and high tables. The seating arrangements are flexible, accommodating large groups and those who wish to dine alone.
The walls are adorned with vibrant murals depicting various aspects of university life and local landmarks, giving the space a unique, youthful, and energetic vibe.
The atmosphere in the food court is always lively and vibrant, filled with the infectious energy of students refueling between classes, discussing their latest projects, or simply hanging out and enjoying their meals.
Scene Details:
Evan had been strategic, leading Sarah on a route that unavoidably passed the spot of their first kiss. He paused there, gazing at her with an intensity that made her heart thump against her ribs. &quot;I’ve been waiting to kiss you again since the first moment I saw you today,” he confessed, his voice rough.
Gently, Evan's fingers curled around hers, the sensation setting a tremor of awareness coursing through her. &quot;Come with me,&quot; he suggested, his voice as soft and alluring as the hold he had on her hand.
Sarah recoiled slightly, confusion flickering in her eyes. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked, her tone wavering between uncertainty and curiosity.
“I’m holding your hand.” His reply was casual, as though it were the most natural thing in the world. Anticipating her need for an explanation, he added, “I figured it was okay. Everything less than that is allowed once you’ve gone to a certain point with someone. Since we already kissed twice, holding hands seems a given.”
Despite the knots of anxiety tying her stomach into pretzel-like twists, Sarah discovered she couldn't quite fight off the lure of Evan’s infectious confidence. His logic was faultless, and the thought occurred to her—That does make sense!—adding an almost humorous slant to her internal dilemma. As they meandered through the bustling food court, immersed in the vibrant chatter that encapsulated the university's social scene, she felt her hand comfortably nestle into his. 
The food court was a vibrant hub of activity. Students moved to and fro, their laughter and discussions creating an ambient hum that echoed around the vast space. The air was rich with the tantalizing scent of food from different cultures, and the murals that adorned the walls injected a youthful energy into the surroundings. Amid the chaos and noise, Sarah and Evan stood out, their hands interlocked in a silent promise of an unforeseen journey.
But with every passing minute, Sarah’s unease grew. Everywhere they went, students gave Evan friendly nods, simple smiles, or a casual wave of the wrist. The knowing looks and insinuating whispers from the predominantly female crowd were disconcerting. She wondered if she'd become an intruder in his world. She began to question why he had chosen her of all people.
Prompted by Evan, they found themselves seated at a table, the noise and activity of the food court reduced to a dull hum in the background. Evan returned shortly with bottles of water and fruit cups, a simple and light snack as per Sarah’s request.
The exchange began with the basics: their names and simple introductions. But when Evan asked her to share something more about herself, a wave of awkwardness washed over Sarah. She was so accustomed to the structure of professional interactions, the conversational ebb and flow of academic dialogues, that this request for personal detail felt foreign, disarming.
Unconsciously, she slipped into autopilot mode. The socially naive part of her receded, replaced by the poised, articulate woman who had faced countless academic panels and job interviews. With the clinical precision of a resume, she began to list her accomplishments, her words spilling out in an educated, polished tumble of phrases that felt jarringly out of place in the casual environment.
Across the table, Evan watched her, his eyes sparkling with a quiet warmth. He saw her struggle, her resort to what was comfortable and familiar. Instead of interrupting or correcting her, he chose to sit back, a gentle smile playing on his lips. He was attentive, listening to each word with interest, and his expression was one of sheer fascination. There was an undeniable charm in her earnest recital, in the passionate way she recounted her academic accomplishments, in her slight discomfort navigating the unfamiliar waters of personal conversation. In the subtle crinkle of his eyes, the softening of his gaze, anyone looking would see the deepening of Evan’s affection for Sarah, an adoration unphased by her unconventional response.
The silence that hung between them after Sarah finished speaking was palpable, carrying the weight of her misstep. But within Evan's patient gaze, there was no judgment—only an eagerness to know more, to delve deeper into the complex enigma that was Sarah.
As the minutes passed, Sarah could feel the weight of awkwardness settle over them. The thrill of their earlier encounter was rapidly giving way to her self-doubt and anxiety. Overwhelmed, Sarah fled, her flight triggered by her own insecurities, fear, and uncertainty.

            <Title>Evan Professes His Love</Title>
            <Text>With the fundraiser behind them, Evan and Sarah made their way hand-in-hand to the hotel elevators, their faces glowing from the shared success of the night. The event had gone off without a hitch, transcending both of their highest hopes. They had eaten, laughed, and charmed the attendees, their effortless synergy captivating everyone in the room. Sarah's poise and zeal had been instrumental, contributing to an astounding 10% increase in donations compared to the previous year.
As Evan witnessed Sarah take command of the room, his feelings for her transformed into something profound. He saw a side of her that was uniquely vibrant and driven. Any lingering doubts or uncertainties evaporated; he knew now, without reservation, that he was in love with Sarah. There was no turning back.
While waiting for the elevator, Evan turned to Sarah, his eyes glowing. &quot;You were incredible tonight. I've never seen anyone work a room like that before.&quot;
Sarah laughed, a soft blush coloring her cheeks. &quot;And you, Evan, you were amazing. I couldn't have done it without you.&quot;
The elevator door dinged open, and they stepped inside, continuing to gush over each other's performance. The air between them was charged with excitement and admiration.
When the elevator opened, Evan walked Sarah to her hotel room door, where their kisses were slow, soft, and sensual.
&quot;I hope you aren’t upset that I booked us in separate rooms. I’m not sure that I’m ready,&quot; Sarah said, looking up at him with a mix of hope and uncertainty.
&quot;Upset? A free room all to myself in a five-star luxury hotel? Why would I be upset?&quot; Evan replied, his smile genuine.
&quot;I know I’m moving kind of slow compared to other college girls my age,&quot; Sarah continued, but Evan interrupted her, his voice gentle but firm.
&quot;I’m not bothered by the speed of our relationship at all,&quot; he reassured her, looking into her eyes with a sincerity that touched her heart. &quot;It’s so easy to get sex these days. But having what we have is special. It’s something that can’t be manufactured or forced. It just is.&quot;
&quot;What is it you find special about us?&quot; Sarah asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
Evan took a few minutes to answer, his gaze penetrating her more profoundly than ever before. &quot;Sarah Wilkins, I’m in love with you. And I’ll wait for eternity to make love if that’s how much time you need.&quot;
He leaned in and kissed her soft and sensually. Sarah had never had anyone tell her they loved her in this way. Her body shivered from head to toe. She wanted to reciprocate Evan’s words of love, but she couldn’t get the words out.
&quot;Evan, I’m afraid –&quot; she began, but he interrupted her, putting his index finger gently over her lips.
&quot;Shh. You don’t need to say anything before you’re ready. I will cherish the moment you tell me you love me, but I only want to hear it when all fear and doubts are gone.&quot;
Evan leaned in and gave Sarah a final sensual kiss that caused her body to tremble even more. Without saying anything more, he headed to his room.
Evan's words weren't just spoken; they were felt, igniting a fire within Sarah that consumed her entire being. It was a love so new, so fresh, and so powerful, it reverberated in the very core of her soul, leaving her body trembling uncontrollably. I never knew love could feel like this, she thought, awash with a sensation that transcended mere words. The profundity of the moment hung in the air, forever altering her understanding of what it meant to be loved. I never could've imagined how good hearing those words would feel. It was not just a statement, but a promise, a turning point that marked the beginning of a new chapter in her life, filled with a passion and connection she never thought possible.</Text>

Scene Name: Sarah’s Makeover
Summary: At Katie's hairdresser's salon, Sarah receives a makeover, including low lights. While waiting, Katie Googles Evan, getting positive information from her roommate's sister. The encouraging news starts to shift Sarah's thoughts, making her consider that a relationship with Evan might indeed be possible.
Characters: Sarah, Katie, Nicole
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Shear Elegance Hair Salon
Setting: Tucked away in the heart of a vibrant central Illinois lies an unassuming, yet undeniably modern hair salon. Through the large glass facade, the salon's chic and bustling atmosphere beckons to both casual passersby and dedicated customers alike.
Upon crossing the threshold, visitors are met with an airy, open space, replete with the gentle hum of hairdryers, the soft rustle of foil, and the low murmur of friendly conversation. The flooring is a modern marvel, laid out with sleek, polished wooden planks that lend a warm, contemporary touch to the space.
To the right of the entrance, an intimate seating area is neatly arranged. An elegant, tufted couch in a muted gray is flanked by a pair of sleek armchairs. Placed strategically, this area allows Katie to comfortably observe the transformation process from her seat, keeping a watchful eye on Sarah as Nicole works her magic.
Running parallel to the left wall are several state-of-the-art hairstyling stations. Each boasts a large, backlit mirror framed by brushed steel, and a swivel chair upholstered in rich, black leather. Mobile carts filled with an array of high-end hair care products and advanced tools are stationed conveniently next to each chair.
Nicole tends to Sarah at the third station from the entrance, providing a perfect line of sight to Katie from the reflective mirror. The overall lighting is artfully designed to cast an inviting glow over the area, highlighting the natural finishes of the wooden floor and the sophisticated furnishings.
Adding a touch of biophilia, strategically placed potted plants bring a sense of calm and vitality to the salon. The back wall serves as a stylish product display, with lit glass shelves housing an impressive range of premium hair care products and styling tools.
Tucked in the back corner of the salon, a glass partition subtly separates the wash station from the main area. Here, plush, reclining chairs face ceramic sinks, each equipped with modern showerheads, providing a comfortable and relaxing hair-washing experience for clients.
With its soft background music and contemporary aesthetic, this small-town salon rivals its big-city counterparts, promising clients not just a hairstyling appointment, but a luxury experience that caters to their modern tastes.
Tone: Exciting, hopeful, anticipatory, friendly
Weather: Partly cloudy and nice outside.

[[This is the one and only time that this salon will be the setting in the story. Whenever I introduce a new location, I like to start the scene off with a description as the characters enter the scene. Use the &quot;Setting: &quot; marker in this template for a detailed description.]]
Nicole: Katie’s hairstylist, Nicole Jenkins, was just finishing up with a client when Katie and Sarah arrived at her salon. “Have a seat. I’ll be with you in a second” 
[[Nicole finished with the client, cleaned up, and called for Katie and Sarah to come to her station.]]
Nicole: [[A surprised Nicole took one look at Sarah, then turned to Katie]] “Is this the same girl that’s in the picture you sent?”
Katie: “Amazing what a pair of jeans and some contact lenses can do. Nicole, this is my dear friend, Sarah. Sarah, this is my friend and stylist, Nicole.”
Sarah: “It’s a pleasure to meet you” [[Sarah extended her hand out for a hand shake.]]
Nicole: [[Nicole shook Sarah’s hand]]  “Nice to meet you as well.”
[[Describe Nicole as she seats Sarah]]
Nicole:  “Have a seat Sarah. What are we doing today?“
Katie: “The works!”
Nicole: [[Nicole took a minute or two before speaking.]] “This is unusual for me. On my website, I have before and after pictures of my makeovers. You already look like an ‘after’ girl. What do you think, Katie?”
Katie: “She is stunning, but I think we need to change things up. Are you okay with that, Sarah?”
Sarah: “Whatever you both decide is fine with me, as long as my hair will still be appropriate for professional occasions.”
Nicole: “Here’s what I think we should do.“As pretty as you are, you’re one shade of white—fair skin, blonde hair, etc. I say let’s add some low lights. Also, we’ll straighten your hair and cut a few inches off the bottom. Not only will you look super-hot for your date tonight, but it will look great for any professional engagement! How does that sound?” asked Nicole.
Katie: “That sounds great!”
Sarah: “Works for me!” 
[[Sarah being so unmanageable to change shows the reader, that at least for tonight she is truly embracing the moment]]
[[Nicole made a plan in her head.]] 
Nicole: “We’ll get your hair started right away; then we’ll do a full mani-pedi, wax your brows, and finish with your makeup.”
[[Katie played games on her phone while Nicole placed the low lights in Sarah’s hair. Once all the foil was in place, Nicole worked on Sarah’s mani-pedi.]]
Nicole: “Tell me about this guy your dating tonight.”
Sarah: “I know little about him. All I know is his name is Evan.”
Katie: “I’m sure I can dig up some information on him. Is he a student? A senior?” 
Sarah: “I am not sure, but he seemed to know everybody. I would guess he is a senior or least an upperclassman.”
Katie: “Hmm, I think that’s enough information. There can’t be that many Evans. Let me text my roommate’s sister. She’s a senior and knows many people. In the meantime, I’ll Google him and see what I find.”
Nicole: “Where is your date tonight?”
[[Katie answered for Sarah]] 
Katie: “He’s taking her to that nice Thai place on Kirby Avenue! She could use some dating tips; this is her first date since high school.”
Nicole: “That’s surprising! I’ve dated my fair share of men. My best advice for you would be to be yourself tonight. Don’t pretend to be something you’re not. That never works out. Are you nervous?”
[[Sarah tells the girls that she is more confused and disoriented and nervous. She explained she so use to dealing with situations analytically, not emotionally.]]
Katie: “Analytical or not, Sarah, you’re still a woman. I saw the way your face lit up when you told me about how he kissed you. Where is the analysis and that?”
Sarah: “You have a point there. I guess I embraced the feeling, but I can’t live in that place forever. I need to find some resolution tonight, so I can get back to focusing on my real life.”
Nicole: “Resolution?”
Sarah: “I like the idea of having a boyfriend, but I need to make sure the relationship doesn’t distract me from my goals.”
Nicole: “A relationship? Don’t you think it might be too soon to talk about that? It might scare him away.” 
Katie:  “I think I might’ve found him! Do you know if he works as a personal trainer?”
Sarah: “Could be. He’s got the body for it.” 
[[Katie opened the website for a local fitness center and navigated to the personal trainer section.]]
Katie:  “Wow! Is this him?” 
[[Katie showed Evan’s picture on her phone to Sarah.]]
“Yep, that’s him!” Sarah said with a bit of pride in her voice.
[[Katie showed the picture to Nicole]]
Nicole:  “He is hot!”
Katie: “His full name is Evan Vaughn. Let me text his name to my roommate’s sister and let’s see what we can find out!” 
[[A few minutes later, the texts started rolling in.]] 
Katie: “Were you walking around campus holding his hand the other day?” 
Sarah: “Yes, and it was horrible; everybody was staring at us like we committed some kind of crime or something.” 
[[Katie let out a long, loud laugh as she sent a text.]] 
Katie: “You’re the mystery woman!”
Sarah: “Mystery woman?” 
Katie: “The reason everyone was staring at you two was that they thought Evan was dating a professor” [[she continued to crack up laughing as she spoke]]. “It was scandalous!”
[[Nicole joined in the laughing fest, but Sarah was not amused.]] “I don’t know why people can’t mind their own business.”
[[The conversation was quiet for a few moments while Katie read through her texts.]] “If it’s any consolation, girl, you hit the jackpot! My friend says this guy is highly coveted. Let me see if I can get some more details.” 
[[Katie sent out a few texts and waited for replies.]]
Nicole: “It sounds promising so far!”
[[Katie read through her texts.]] 
Katie: “Here’s the scoop. The consensus is that he is a great guy, but you should avoid his best friend, Guido. Evan has had a few girlfriends since he has been here but doesn’t seem to be looking for anything serious. Does that bother you?”
Sarah: “That’s perfect for me. The last thing I need is a serious relationship. A companion for a while, or maybe for the school year, has appeal. Anything more might derail me.”
A couple of hours later and the makeover was complete. 
[[Nicole turned the chair around so Sarah could look into the mirror and stated]] 
Nicole: “My work here is done!”
Katie: “Sarah, you look incredible– hotter than hot! Like I knew you would! No one is going to mistake you for a professor tonight. I can’t wait to go shopping for a new outfit to match your new look.”
[[Sarah stared at herself for a few minutes in the mirror]]
Nicole:  “Do you not like it?” 
“It’s incredible. This situation is all overwhelming and surreal. I think it’s just now registering that I’m about to go on a date with a guy I hardly know and break my number one rule.”
Nicole attempted to comfort Sarah. “Try not to make such a big deal about it. It is just a first date. Use this as an opportunity to get to know him better and then see where it goes.”
[[Sarah thanked Nicole, paid her bill, leaving her a huge tip. She and Katie then headed out to do some shopping. ]]
Sarah: “Katie, would you mind staying in my apartment while I’m on my date? If you like, we can stop by your dorm so you can grab clothes and study material and stay the night. I feel like I might need a friend before the night is over.”
[[Katie gave Sarah a big warm hug]]
Katie:  “Of course I’ll be there for you.”</Text>

Scene Template:
Title: Sarah Relaxes in the Tub
Summary:
After Evan professes his love and they share a sensual kiss, Sarah is left in a state of bliss. Enjoying a bath in her luxury hotel room, she reflects on her feelings for Evan. A decision made, she later entrusts an envelope with unknown contents to a trusted hotel staff member, asking her to slip it under Evan's door. The night's profound events linger in her mind, wrapping her in euphoria and leaving her eager for what the future holds.
Leading Context:
In the preceding scene, Evan declared his love for Sarah, reassuring her that he would patiently wait for her to be ready before they made love. He emphasized that he wanted her to verbally express her love only when all her fears and doubts had vanished. Contentment in his heart and a smile on his lips, he then headed to his room, the memory of their sensual goodnight kiss still lingering on his mind.
Setting:
Location: Sarah's Luxury Suite at the Grandeur Hotel. 
Weather/Environment: A clear night.
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Sarah, Evan
Secondary Characters: A trusted female member of the hotel staff. Her name was Nina.
Character Emotional State:
Sarah: Apprehensive, Nervous, Excited, Amorous.
Evan: Excited, Amorous.
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)
Dialogue Focus: Moderate
Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate.
Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
[ Sarah's body quivered and her hands shook after Evan professed his love to her, ending the night with a sensual kiss. ]
[ With her hands shaking, she struggled to get the key card into the hotel room. ]
[ Sarah was on cloud nine, every cell in her body vibrating. She couldn't have been happier that Evan had just told her that he loved her. Use deep POV and internal dialogue to show the reader how Sarah was feeling. ]
[ When Sarah entered her en suite luxury bathroom, please describe in vivid detail so the reader will understand just how luxurious this bathroom was. ]
Sarah decided to take a bath. Everything seemed to be moving in slow motion, including Sarah, as she started running the bathwater.
Sarah added 10 drops of rose-scented essential oil to her bath water.
She carefully stepped in to the heavenly bathwater.
Middle:
[ While writing this part of the scene where Sarah was enjoying her bath, use deep POV and internal dialogue to describe Sarah's thoughts. ]
While bathing, Sarah relived the entire evening in her mind – relishing every moment. Then her mind started to focus on Evan's profession of love. Just the memory of him telling her he loved her shot an instant wave of energy throughout her body. As the bath ended, she remembered the final sensual kiss.
[ Sarah got out of the tub, towel-dried her hair, and put on a fluffy luxurious white robe provided by the hotel. ]
As Sarah brushed her teeth and blow-dried her hair, her thoughts shifted to Evan's final words to her before heading to his room. He had told Sarah that he would wait an eternity to make love to her if that's how much time she needed. She remembered the last thing he said to her, “I will cherish the moment you tell me you love me, but I only want to hear it when all fear and doubts are gone.” 
[ Keep the reader captivated with continued deep POV, internal dialogue, and as much show versus tell as possible. ]
After Sarah finished blow-drying her hair, she decided that she wasn't going to resist her feelings for Evan anymore. She loved him. She had no fears and no doubts about her love. She was ready to tell him.
She was still nervous about making love with Evan for the first time. But her apprehension wasn't about her feelings for Evan, but her fear that her lack of experience in bed would result in her being an inadequate lover – at least for the first time they made love. 
[ What happens next will leave a little mystery for the reader. ]
Despite her fears, Sarah smiled as she looked at herself in the mirror. She dabbed a small amount of perfume on her finger and applied it behind her ears and on her chest just below her throat.
[ In this next segment, describe what Sarah was doing without explaining why she was doing it. ]
Sarah left the bathroom and headed straight for the hotel room phone. She pressed the room service button and asked for a trusted staff member, Nina. (Sarah had held many events at this hotel and knew most of the staff.)
[ The envelope, the small notepad, and the pen Sarah used to write with were all standard amenities located on the work desk in Sarah's hotel room. ]
End: 
While she waited for room service, she wrote on a small notepad. She tore the note off the pad and placed it into an envelope. 
Sarah then went to her purse and grabbed an item from the purse and placed it in the envelope, along with the note, and then sealed the envelope.
Finally, she wrote on the envelope, &quot;Evan&quot; with a heart next to his name.
[ A knock on the door got Sarah's attention. Sarah grabbed the envelope and a $20 bill and headed to her hotel room door. ]
She smiled Nina, handed her the envelope and the $20 tip, told her Evan's room number, and asked her to slip the envelope underneath his door.
Nina, smiled back, having a pretty good idea of what was in the envelope, and confirmed she was on her way to deliver the envelope.
Objectives/Goals:
This scene follows Sarah's thought process, as she finally releases her resistance to admitting that she has fallen in love with Evan.
This scene has a bit of mystery to it. The secret is that after she blow-dried her hair, she not only is ready to tell Evan that she loves him, but she's ready to make love to him. The reader gets a subtle hint of what is to come of the evening.

Character Profile:
Name: Guido
Nickname: Guido. His real name is Anthony Moretti, but everyone calls him Guido
No one is sure who gave Guido the nickname—some suspect he gave it to himself. One thing is for sure. He embraced his nickname.

His teeth are bright white.

Every inch of his 210-pound frame seemed crafted for both appearance and strength, a blend of form and function that he took great pride in.
His skin was tan from head to toe, a product of regular tanning salon visits.

While some women were drawn to his macho, bad-boy image, others found themselves repelled by it. His appearance was polarizing, to say the least, but it was clear that Guido wouldn't have it any other way.

Guido's relationship with women:
Guido considers getting women to sleep with him as a numbers game. He figures the more women he hits on, the better his chances of taking them to bed. He is not offended if he gets rejected. To him, rejection is just part of the game. Guido presents himself as &quot;the bad boy.&quot; He often refers to his bad boy image as &quot;The Guido.&quot; He hypothesizes that most women need to sleep with at least one &quot;bad boy&quot; before they marry &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; As &quot;The Guido,&quot; he is happy to fulfill the role of the &quot;bad boy&quot; guilty pleasure that he believes women need to experience at least once in their life.
Character Description:
Guido, a 21-year-old Italian-American male, also known as Anthony Moretti, is a striking figure in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 210 pounds, Guido has transformed himself into a well-muscled specimen, testament to his relentless gym routine. With a body always meticulously tanned, teeth gleaming bright white, and hair held firmly in place with gel, Guido's appearance is as ostentatious as the gold jewelry he flaunts.
Guido's personality is as bold and flashy as his appearance. Brash, unapologetic, and often crude, he's known to push people's buttons and enjoys playing the role of &quot;the bad boy.&quot; Guido's voice carries a streetwise, tough-guy tone, making him sound like a blend of Joey Tribbiani from the TV show &quot;Friends&quot; and the crude comic Andrew Dice Clay. Despite this, his loyalty to his close friends is unwavering, and he's quick to volunteer help when they're in need.
Guido's interests reflect his personality. A die-hard fan of Chicago's sports teams, he loves playing basketball and softball, with gambling being his main hobby. He's dismissive of judgmental people, though he can be one himself, and despises being controlled in any form.
He drives a well-worn Honda Civic and works as a personal trainer, all while pursuing a degree in Finance. His dreams are straightforward, aspiring to save enough money to retire by age 45.
Guido's relationship with women is a numbers game, objectifying them as commodities, unfazed by rejection. He's proud of his &quot;bad boy&quot; image and is willing to play the role for any woman looking for a guilty pleasure. However, beneath his outgoing demeanor, he's quite guarded, fearing commitment and allowing only a few people into his inner circle.
In times of crisis, Guido's no-nonsense approach shines, always ready to aid a friend in need. Whether instigating conflicts with his hot temper or offering comic relief with his wisecracks, Guido's presence is always felt.
His character serves as Evan's best friend throughout the story, providing both support and entertainment. However, most people see Guido as irritating rather than charming, reflecting his brash and arrogant demeanor.
In summary, Guido is a complex character, a blend of vanity and warmth, charm, and loyalty. His contradictions make him intriguing, while his unapologetic approach to life sets him apart as a character not easily forgotten or ignored.

            <Notes>If a scene is too extensive to fit into a single message and needs to be broken into parts, you can follow a similar approach to maintain continuity and ensure that I understand these parts make up a single scene:
Divide the Scene into Logical Parts: Break the scene into logical segments that can be sent in separate messages. These could be based on shifts in action, dialogue, or focus within the scene.
Label Each Part Clearly: When you send each part, label it clearly to indicate its place in the sequence. This will help me understand that each message is a continuation of the same scene.
Provide Context or Transition if Needed: If necessary, include a brief recap or transition to link the parts together. This might be useful if there's a gap in time between sending the different parts.
Explicitly State Your Intent: Make it clear from the beginning that the messages are parts of a single scene and that they should be treated as one continuous narrative.
For example, your messages could be structured like:
&quot;Scene 0200, Part 1: Evan waits for Sarah at the parking lot...&quot;
&quot;Scene 0200, Part 2: Sarah arrives, and Evan presents the doll...&quot;

Certainly! Here's how you could structure a scene that is broken into parts, using the information from your scene titled &quot;0200 Evan Gives Sarah the Vintage Doll.&quot; I'll show how the general details are presented in Part 1, and then how you might proceed in Part 2 without repeating the same information.

**Scene 0200, Part 1: Evan Gives Sarah the Vintage Doll**
*Characters:* Evan, Sarah
*Location:* Large recreation area in central Illinois
*Setting:* Parking lot adjacent to the softball field
*Time and Day:* Sunday morning
*Weather:* Partly sunny, a typical crisp, cool morning in early fall in central Illinois
*Emotional Tone:* Sweet, sentimental, young love is in the air, Humor

(Scene details, dialogue, and description for Part 1 here.)

**Scene 0200, Part 2: Evan Introduces Sarah to His Friends**
*Special Instructions:* This part continues directly from Part 1, with all the same characters, setting, etc. In this part, Evan and Sarah head to the bleachers, and Evan introduces Sarah to his inner circle of friends.

(Scene details, dialogue, and description for Part 2 here.)

By clearly stating that Part 2 continues directly from Part 1 and shares the same overall context, you avoid needing to repeat the general details while still providing any specific information relevant to that part of the scene. This structure helps maintain continuity and consistency across the parts of the scene.</Notes>

            <Text>Patti settled in to watch the softball game. Her eyes immediately drifted to Sarah, who sat a few rows down, her head buried in a book. She was pretty, Patti admitted to herself. But why a book at a softball game? Why did Evan choose her? The thoughts stung, and a familiar jealousy welled up within her.
Sarah looked up every now and then, mostly when Evan was up to bat, and returned to her book, titled &quot;Softball for Dummies.&quot; Her smile was genuine, her eyes filled with a keen desire to understand the game, to support Evan.
Roxanne, seated beside Patti, seemed to have already made up her mind about Sarah. Unable to see the title of the book from her vantage point, her face twisted in irritation, she whispered, “Can you fucking believe she's reading a book at her boyfriend's softball game?”
Patti's lips pressed into a thin line. She wanted to share Roxanne's disdain but couldn't shake off her conflict. The morning air was crisp, but as the game progressed, the sun warmed the field, mirroring the increasing tension in Patti's mind.
Let's get something to drink, Patti suggested, standing up. I'm headed to the concession stand. Can I grab anyone a beer or something to drink?
Roxanne grumbled her order, and Patti turned to Sarah. Unaware of what a concession stand cells, Sarah asked if they served wine. I don’t think they have any wine, but they may have some wine coolers. Would you like something else instead? My treat!
Sarah looked up, surprised and appreciative. No, thank you, she replied, her voice soft.
Roxanne rolled her eyes and mumbled an insult, but Patti shot her a scolding look and silently mouthed, Knock it off.
The game was heating up, the score tied, Evan on third base, and Guido up to bat. The energy in the bleachers was palpable, and even Sarah was now fully vested in the game, her book forgotten. She pulled out the pendant that Evan had made for her, rubbing it nervously. Patti noticed the unique design, sensing its significance.
Guido swung, connecting with a satisfying crack. The ball soared, and Evan sprinted home, scoring the winning run. The crowd erupted in cheers, Sarah jumping up and down, her face alight with excitement. Patti wanted to join in, but her enthusiasm was dampened, her eyes fixed on Sarah. Roxanne muttered something about Sarah being fake, but Patti barely heard her.
Evan and Guido dashed toward the bleachers, high-fiving and hugging friends. Evan made a beeline for Sarah, picking her up and spinning her around before planting a passionate kiss on her lips. To Patti, it felt like a punch in the gut, a slap in the face.
Guido invited everyone to &quot;Sluggers,&quot; a sports bar and grille, for a post-game celebration. As Evan and Sarah headed to the car, Patti asked Guido about the pendant. His explanation, the story behind it, felt like a knockout punch. She had never known Evan to be creative like that. She had never received any sentimental gifts when they were together.
Roxanne's complaints about Evan's insensitivity were drowned out by a feeling of resignation in Patti. The scene ended with her voice, low and defeated, asking Guido, He's in love with her, isn't he?
Guido's shrug, his silence, said it all.</Text>

Draft Scene:
[[ Sarah opened the door to her apartment, stepped in, closed the door behind her, then leaned back against the door and let out a tremendous sigh. She felt a mixture of emotions including but not limited to, vibratory, relieved, orgasmic, weightless. ]]
Katie: “I am guessing by the look on your face that the date went well?”
Sarah: “It was perfect,” 
[[ Sarah sighed again. ]]
[[ And excited Katie jumped up and down and gave Sarah a big hug.]] 
Katie: “I’m so happy for you, Sarah. Come sit down, let’s talk.”
[[ Sarah followed Katie to the couch. When they sat down, she showed Katie her pendant. ]]
Sarah: “Evan calls me his Cinderella because I’m always trying to run away from him like it’s midnight.” 
[[ Sarah explained the full meaning behind the necklace. She also described the process by which Evan had it made for her. The retelling of the necklace story brought tears to both of their eyes. ]]
Katie: “Oh, Sarah, that’s so romantic. I swear you are the luckiest woman I know.”
Sarah: “I feel like the luckiest woman alive!” 
[[ Sarah’s phone buzzed with a Facebook message. It was a relationship request from Evan. She showed the Facebook message to Katie. ]]
Sarah: “Evan wants me to confirm that we’re in a relationship.”
Katie: “Are you in a relationship?” 
[[ Sarah smiled and nodded, yes. ]] 
Katie: “Wow, you move fast! Are you going to confirm it?”
Sarah: “I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to do anything more in my life,” 
[[ She pressed the on-screen button to confirm to Facebook that she and Evan are in a relationship. ]]
Katie: “I can’t wait for all the details. You are glowing!”
Sarah: “I feel incredible, Katie! In a single day, I have a new amazing friend and a new amazing boyfriend. For the first time, I feel like a normal woman!” 
[[ Have Katie cup her hands over her heart or similar silent gesture or facial expression to show how touched she is when Sarah called her and amazing new friend. maybe insert that into the middle of the dialogue line above. Where you think it fits best.  ]]
[[ Sarah repeated herself as she thrust back against the cushion in jubilation. ]] 
Sarah: “A normal woman!”
[[ Either through dialogue to Katie or through internal thoughts, this is a good time for Sarah to think or say that while in the past, she was critical of the girls that seemed to spend all their time chattering about boys, she finally understands what it's like to have these romantic feelings for a man. She finally knows where feels like to be kissed romantically. She finally gets it, and she loves these feelings of emotion. 
In this moment at least, she would trade this endorphin-laced moment of ecstasy, for every rational thought she's ever had.
We want to leave the reader feeling how Sarah feels at this moment. ]]

            <Text>Please create the scene using the following information.
Scene Information:
Scene Title: Evan Calls Liz for Advice
Summary: 
Feeling dejected after failing to find Sarah following their kiss, Evan seeks guidance by calling his sister, Liz. Her comforting words and insightful advice lift his spirits, leaving him rejuvenated and more determined. The conversation with his sister not only provides solace but inspires him to continue his pursuit of a connection with Sarah. 
Characters:
Evan: He calls Liz for advice about finding Sarah. 
Liz: She lists Evan’s spirits with her words about Sarah. She has concerns about his health. 
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective. 
Location: Evan’s bedroom
Setting: Evan and Liz are communicating via mobile phone.
Time: 11 AM
Emotional Tone:  Worry, Distress, Relief, Optimism 
Backstory: After kissing Sarah two days earlier, Evan is distressed that he has not been able to find her since.
Scene Conclusion: 
The scene ends on a positive note. Liz boosts Evan’s confidence that if it’s meant to be, it will be, and Evan believes it will be.
Now that Evan feels much better, the final line should have Evan texting Guido that he no longer needs Guido to cover his training sessions. 
Special Instructions: 
Use the provided scene verbatim, excluding embedded instructions. Adapt and incorporate embedded instructions into the scene as seamlessly as possible while maintaining the original dialogue and narration.
Use the narrative to enhance the existing dialogue, emphasizing character emotions, internal thoughts, and the setting as necessary. However, ensure the dialogue remains the central mechanism for moving the plot forward.
Integrate dialogue tags an action tags at your full discretion.
Remove all speaker labels identified by the character name followed by a colon and a space. Example &quot;Evan: &quot;
Other Notes: 
In this scene, there is a subtle hint that Evan’s health may not be as good as it seems. In this book, Evan is healthy and has no illness diagnosis.
However, in the future, the issues of Evan’s energy drop mentioned in the scene are due to an undiagnosed bone disease.
Evan’s distrust of doctors and aversion to prolonged use of pharmaceutical drugs will become relevant in the future.
While the primary purpose of this scene is to show the relationship between Evan and his sister and be the impetus for him to gain confidence for his next attempt at finding Sarah, it also sets up the subplot of Evan’s disease.
The Sequence of Events: 
[[ Evan’s alarm goes off at 11 AM. I like the reader to experience a deep POV with how Evan is feeling this morning, unmotivated, on wanting to get up.
	He is already snoozed it multiple times.
On a typical Saturday, Evan gets up at 8 o’clock for a morning jog and a workout.
Severely disappointed that he didn’t find Sarah on the rainy Friday the day before, he lacks the motivation to get up.
Even a Cubs victory night before did not lift his spirits.
During the many snooze alarms, around 9 AM, Evan asked Guido to cover his client training sessions for the afternoon. The readers should be informed.
Feeling helpless about how to find Sarah, he makes a phone call to the person who’s always there for him, his sister, Liz. ]] 
[[ Evan called Liz. ]]
Liz: “Hello?” [[ Liz pretended she didn’t know who the caller was. ]]
Evan: “Hey, Liz, do you have a few minutes to talk?”
Liz: “I’m sorry, who is this?”
Evan: “Um, it’s Evan.”
Liz: “Hmm, that name doesn’t ring a bell.”
Evan: “Quit teasing. It’s Evan Vaughn, your brother.”
Liz: “Oh, now I remember. It’s been forever since I’ve heard from my little brother.”
Evan: “It’s only been a couple of weeks.”
Liz: “Six weeks, to be exact. What's up? Are you feeling okay? Are you still having those energy drop issues?”
[[ In the last year or two, the typical healthy Evan will have periods where his energy drops significantly. Sometimes lasting for a couple of hours, sometimes a couple of days. ]]
[[ Liz often asks about his health, causing Evan to feel like she is nagging him. ]]
Evan: &quot;No, I haven't had any problems.&quot;
Liz: &quot;I wish you would go to the doctor and get checked out.&quot;
Evan: &quot;You know how I feel about most doctors. They get kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies. They're chomping at the bit to prescribe drugs when most of the all that is needed is proper diet and exercise.&quot;
Liz: &quot;You and your fear of doctors. I'll never understand.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I've seen more than one friend or family get addicted to prescribed painkillers and antidepressants. You've seen it too.&quot;
Liz: &quot;I'm asking you to go to the doctor, not get addicted to painkillers.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm fine, Liz. Please stop worrying. We have to get a physical every six months for work, and I just got mine a few weeks ago. I got a clean bill of health.&quot;
Liz: &quot;I would've known that if you had called me.&quot;
[[ Liz said in a teasing way. It's important to know Liz and Evan never fight or get angry with each other. But they do like to tease each other. ]]
Evan: “I’m sorry, I’ve been busy with school and work – “
[[ Interrupted ]] 
Liz: “And sports and parties and girls.”
[[ Evan laughed. ]]
Evan: “That’s what I called to talk about, girls. Well, one girl in particular. I think she’s the one.”
Liz’s ears perked up.
Liz: “The one? Do tell.”
Evan: &quot;I literally bumped into her on the way to the library. She was in a rush and headed for a hard fall. I was lucky enough to get there in the knick of time before she hit the ground. Next thing I know, we’re kissing. Oh my God, Liz. It was the best kiss of my life.&quot;
Liz: &quot;What a wonderful way to meet! Tell me more about her.&quot;
Evan: &quot;That's the thing, Liz; I know nothing about her. She ran away without so much as giving me her name.&quot;
Liz: &quot;Why do you think she ran away? Was she upset you kissed her?&quot;
Evan: &quot;No, Liz, you taught me always to be respectful. In the heat of the moment, I told her I wanted to kiss her. And she said I could. So I did!&quot;
Liz: &quot;I'm proud of you for being respectful. But then, why did she run?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I wish I knew. Guido thinks she has a boyfriend, but I said no way that's true. I think she ran because she was late for class. At least, I hope that was the reason. I waited for her to return, but she never showed. I returned the next day, and still, she didn't show.&quot;
Liz: &quot;I wouldn't worry too much. You know what I always say.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Yeah, I know. If it's meant to be, it will be.&quot;
[[ Evan said it like he’d heard it a million times before. ]]
Evan: &quot;But Liz, there is something special about this girl. I am desperate to find her. I know it's too soon to be sure, but I feel she's the one for me.&quot;
Liz: &quot;I know it's hard to be patient. But I'm telling you, Evan, the harder you look, the less likely that you'll find her. When you stop looking, she'll appear. That's just how these things work.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Guido said as much. He said I looked pathetic getting soaked, waiting for her in the rain, and then spending hours online last night desperately trying to find her with no luck.&quot;
Liz: &quot;I wish I were there to give you a hug. You're not pathetic for enthusiastically seeking love. But Guido is right to some extent; go back to enjoying life. You put in the effort to find her, and that's a good thing, a great thing. But it's not healthy to become obsessive in your pursuits.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I know you're right. I want to meet her again. I never wanted anything as much in my life.&quot;
Liz: &quot;Do you really think she may be the one?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't think it; I know it!&quot;
Liz: &quot;Then carry that confidence with you until you find her. If it's meant to be, you will find her!&quot; [[ Liz says in an empowering, confident tone. ]]
[[ Liz's words pumped up Evan. ]]
Evan: &quot;You're right! I'm not gonna be pathetic, desperately seeking Sarah. We are meant to be, and the universe will bring her to me again.&quot;
Liz: &quot;Now that's the Evan I know! I know you're going to find her. I've never heard you call any girl 'the one.' And I'm especially impressed you met her on the way to the library!&quot;
[[ They both laughed at the library comment. ]]
Evan: &quot;That just proves how awesome my sister is. I never would've met her if you didn't make me promise to keep my grades up.&quot;
Liz: &quot;I can't take the credit. But now that you mention it, are you keeping your grades up?&quot;
[[ Teasingly, Evan changed the subject without answering her. ]]
Evan: &quot;No time to talk, Liz; gotta get ready for work.&quot;
[[ Liz laughed at Evan's evasive response. ]]
Liz: &quot;Take care, little brother. Promise you'll call me if you have any more energy drop episodes?&quot;
Evan: [[ Mildly annoyed by Liz's overprotective nature. ]] &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll call you. Gotta run; love you, sis!&quot;
Liz: &quot;Love ya too.&quot;
[[ A rejuvenated Evan either texts Guido or pops his head into Guido’s bedroom and tells Guido he doesn't need Guido to cover his client sessions because he (Evan) feels great! ]]</Text>
            <Notes>On the phone call asks Evan about his health.
He says he got a physical
you tell them about how your energy goes off a cliff?
Yes, they said it's not that didn't see anything, probably nothing, but they offered to run a whole battery of tests.
Reader finds out that Evan is not going to tell her anymore. 
You know how I feel about hospitals and doctors. They'll just looking for reasons to put me on some medication o don't need to get their kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies.
jokes she doesn't remember Evan because been so long that he called.
It's only been a couple weeks. 6 weeks to be exact.

            <Title>0150 Sarah’s Makeover</Title>
            <Synopsis>Katie’s hairdresser gives Sarah a makeover.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Tucked away in the heart of vibrant central Illinois lay Shear Elegance Hair Salon, an unassuming, yet undeniably modern hair salon. Through the large glass façade, the salon's chic and bustling atmosphere beckoned to both casual passersby and dedicated customers alike. The partly cloudy and pleasant weather outside contrasted with the salon's warm interior, filled with the gentle hum of hairdryers, the soft rustle of foil, and the low murmur of friendly conversation.
Katie's hairstylist, Nicole Jenkins, was finishing up with a client when Katie and Sarah arrived at her salon. &quot;Have a seat. I'll be with you in a second,&quot; she called, flashing a welcoming smile. Her station, the third from the entrance, provided a perfect line of sight to Katie, who sat on the elegant, tufted couch.
Soon, Nicole finished with the client, cleaned up, and called for Katie and Sarah to come to her station. Her eyes widened as she took in Sarah's appearance. &quot;Is this the same girl in the picture you sent?&quot; she asked Katie, her voice laced with surprise.
&quot;Amazing what a pair of jeans and some contact lenses can do,&quot; Katie chuckled. &quot;Nicole, this is my dear friend, Sarah. Sarah, this is my friend and stylist, Nicole.&quot;
They greeted each other with a warm handshake.
Nicole's eyes studied Sarah's features as she guided her to the swivel chair upholstered in rich, black leather. The salon's contemporary aesthetic and the wooden floor’s natural finishes created a backdrop that emphasized Nicole's professionalism. &quot;Have a seat, Sarah. What are we doing today?&quot; Nicole asked, her voice filled with anticipation.
&quot;The works!&quot; Katie exclaimed, her face lighting up.
Nicole took a minute or two before speaking, her eyes still fixed on Sarah. &quot;This is unusual for me. On my website, I have before and after pictures of my makeovers. You already look like an 'after' girl. What do you think, Katie?&quot;
&quot;She is stunning, but I think we need to change things up. Are you okay with that, Sarah?&quot; Katie asked, her tone both excited and reassuring.
&quot;Whatever you both decide is fine with me, as long as my hair will still be appropriate for professional occasions,&quot; Sarah replied, her voice firm yet trusting.
&quot;Here's what I think we should do. As pretty as you are, you're one shade of light color—fair skin, blonde hair, etc. I say let's add some low lights. Also, we'll straighten your hair and cut a few inches off the bottom. Not only will you look super-hot for your date tonight, but it will look great for any professional engagement! How does that sound?&quot; Nicole asked, her eyes sparkling with ideas.
&quot;That sounds great!&quot; Katie chimed in; her excitement was palpable.
&quot;Works for me!&quot; Sarah agreed, her willingness to embrace change reflecting a newfound excitement.
They settled into a comfortable rhythm as Nicole worked her magic. Katie played games on her phone while Nicole placed the low lights in Sarah's hair, then moved on to her mani-pedi. The conversation flowed naturally, with the women's voices weaving together in the open space of the salon.
&quot;Tell me about this guy you're dating tonight,&quot; Nicole asked, her voice curious.
&quot;I know little about him. All I know is his name is Evan,&quot; Sarah replied, her voice tinged with intrigue.
&quot;I'm sure I can dig up some information on him. Is he a student? A senior?&quot; Katie asked, her fingers already typing on her phone.
&quot;I'm not sure, but he seemed to know everybody. I would guess he is a senior or at least an upperclassman,&quot; Sarah said, her curiosity growing.
&quot;Hmm, I think that's enough information. There can't be that many Evans. Let me text my roommate's sister. She's a senior and knows a lot of people. In the meantime, I'll Google him and see what I find,&quot; Katie said, her voice filled with determination.
Nicole asked, “Where is your date tonight?”
“He’s taking her to that nice Thai place on Kirby Avenue! She could use some dating tips; this is her first date since high school,” Katie answered for Sarah.
Nicole raised an eyebrow, “Since high school!? That’s surprising.”
She paused, her eyes narrowing slightly as she considered her next words carefully. Memories of past dates and relationships seemed to flit across her face. Finally, she nodded to herself and continued, “I’ve dated my fair share of men. My best advice for you would be to be yourself tonight. Don’t pretend to be something you’re not. That never works out. Are you nervous?”
Sarah felt a twinge of confusion, her head tilting slightly. “I’m more confused and disoriented than nervous. I’m used to dealing with situations analytically, not emotionally.”
Katie laughed, “Analytical or not, Sarah, you’re still a woman. I saw how your face lit up when you told me about how he kissed you. Where is the analysis in that?”
“You have a point there,” Sarah conceded, shifting uncomfortably in her seat as she considered the words. “I guess I embraced the feeling, but I can’t live in that place forever. I need to find some resolution tonight, so I can get back to focusing on my real life.”
Nicole frowned, her eyebrows drawing together in concern. “Resolution?”
“I like the idea of having a boyfriend, but I need to make sure the relationship doesn’t distract me from my goals,” Sarah explained, her hands nervously playing with the edge of the salon cape.
Nicole’s eyes widened, her mouth slightly agape. “A relationship? Don’t you think it might be too soon to talk about that? It might scare him away.”
“I think I might’ve found him!” Katie interjected, her face lighting up as she held up her phone. “Do you know if he works as a personal trainer?”
“Could be. He’s got the body for it,” Sarah replied, a slight blush coloring her cheeks.
Katie then opened the website for a local fitness center and navigated to the personal trainer section, showing Evan’s picture to Sarah. “Wow! Is this him?”
“Yep, that’s him!” Sarah said, pride in her voice, her chest puffing out slightly. Katie showed the picture to Nicole.
“He is hot!” Nicole exclaimed, leaning forward to get a closer look.
Katie grinned, her eyes twinkling with mischief. “His full name is Evan Vaughn. Let me text my roommate’s sister his name, and let’s see what we can find out!”
A few minutes later, the texts started rolling in. Katie looked up, her expression curious. “Were you walking around campus holding his hand the other day?”
“Yes, and it was horrible; everybody was staring at us like we committed some kind of crime or something,” Sarah recalled, her face crinkling in distaste.
Katie let out a long, loud laugh as she sent a text, her body shaking with amusement. “You’re the mystery woman!”
“Mystery woman?” Sarah repeated, perplexed, her head tilting to one side.
Katie continued to crack up laughing as she spoke, “The reason everyone was staring at you two was that they thought Evan was dating a professor. It was scandalous!”
Nicole joined in the laughing fest, but Sarah was not amused; her lips pursed tightly. “I don’t know why people can’t mind their own business.”
The conversation was quiet for a few moments while Katie read through her texts, the room filled with the soft sound of her thumb scrolling. Then she said, “If it’s any consolation, girl, you hit the jackpot! My friend says this guy is highly coveted. Let me see if I can get some more details.”
Katie read through her texts and said, “Here’s the scoop. The consensus is that he is a great guy, but you should avoid his best friend, Guido. Evan has had a few girlfriends since he has been here but doesn’t seem to be looking for anything serious. Does that bother you?”
“That’s perfect for me. The last thing I need is a serious relationship. A companion for a while, or maybe for the school year, has appeal. Anything more might derail me,” Sarah responded.
A couple of hours later, the makeover was complete. Nicole turned the chair around so Sarah could look into the mirror and stated, “My work here is done!”
“Sarah, you look incredible– hotter than hot! Like I knew you would! No one is going to mistake you for a professor tonight. I can’t wait to go shopping for a new outfit to match your new look,” Katie cheered.
Sarah stared at herself for a few minutes in the mirror, disbelief etched in her wide eyes. Nicole asked, her voice tinged with uncertainty, “Do you not like it?”
“It’s incredible. This situation is all overwhelming and surreal. I think it’s just now registering that I’m about to go on a date with a guy I hardly know and break my number one rule,” Sarah admitted, her voice full of mixed emotions, her hands trembling slightly.
Nicole attempted to comfort Sarah, and Katie chimed in, “Try not to make such a big deal about it. It is just a first date. Use this as an opportunity to get to know him better and see where it goes.”
Sarah looked at Katie, “Katie, would you mind staying in my apartment while I’m on my date? If you like, we can stop by your dorm so you can grab clothes and study materials and stay the night. I might need a friend before the night is over.”
Katie hugged Sarah warmly, her eyes filled with understanding and support. “Of course, I’ll be there for you.”</Text>

            <Notes>Maybe have a coffee or drink offer from Sarah
Maybe rewrite the first paragraph


Let's expand and animate this part of the scene. I can see Katie awestruck in real life when she walks into a luxury apartment, but to Sarah, it's commonplace. 
While Katie pauses and marvels at this place, maybe walks to the window and looks out the window, Sarah would likely veer off in a separate direction to her kitchen and get something to drink – perhaps wine or coffee or water. In contrast to Sarah, Katie might tell Sarah how great the department is, maybe how incredible the view is. Sarah might offer her something to drink, as anyone would when a new guest comes to their apartment. 
Have Katie accept the drink, and then have Sarah tell Katie to have a seat on her couch. Sarah can then bring her drink to her, sit down and start their chat.
Here are a couple of things to note as you rebuild the first part of this scene. Champaign, Illinois is a small town, so there won't be any extensive city views. If you describe the view out the window, let's have Sarah's apartment look out into an expansive preservation area—lots of trees and greenery with a small appealing creek running through the nature preserve.
I want to start the scene with the reader feeling like there with Sarah and Katie. Right now, it feels like they're just two people talking anywhere. I want to immerse the reader into the scene.
Please rewrite and expand that first paragraph if that's enough to work with. If you need more information, let me know. Were brainstorming here, you have free reign to express your thoughts and ideas.</Notes>

Scene Name: Sarah is Frazzled
Summary: Arriving uncharacteristically late to her class, Sarah is frazzled and out of sorts. Normally well-prepared and professional, she's thrown off by her tardiness. Despite her inner turmoil, she manages to regain her composure, delivering a class session that's engaging and well-received by her students.
Characters: Sarah, Katie
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Sarah's Classroom
Tone: Sarah was frantic at the beginning of class but had an epiphany. She decided to embrace the moment, relax, and conduct a more collaborative teaching session – a  stark contrast from her typical one-way lecture teaching style.
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
Start the scene with a vivid description of the location as defined in the location profile.
Include the confusion and mixed energy of the class as they look at a vacant podium and wonder where their always punctual teacher's assistant, Sarah, is.
The dialogue provided may be used or changed at your discretion.
Sequence of Events:
Sarah arrived 10 minutes late to her Business-101 class. However, that was not the biggest shock for her students. They had never seen their teacher without her glasses on or with her long hair let down.
Hoping to hide the internal chaos she was feeling, she straightened her outfit and her expression. 
Sarah: “I apologize for being late. It will not happen again. Today we will review topics on next week’s exam.”
She wrote on the board. One student raised his hand. “Ms. Wilkins, we have never discussed that material.”
Still lightheaded from her kiss with Evan, Sarah inadvertently wrote information relating to the next section of the course. She took a deep breath, walked to the front of her desk, leaned back in a semi-seated position, and chose a fresh approach to the review session. 
Sarah: “Did you ever have one of those days where something happens that you didn’t expect, and it throws you off your game?”
Most of the class smiled and acknowledged they could relate.
Sarah: “Today is one of those days for me.”
In stark contrast to her usually dry and monotone teaching style, Sarah spoke in a relaxed, relatable tone.
Sarah: “Let me tell you a secret about exams. 80% of the questions simply test your memorization. The other 20% are often trick questions to gauge how thoroughly you understand the material. Let's focus on the trick questions instead of wasting time on simple questions. I think this will give everybody a better chance to ace this exam. Is everyone agreeable to that?”
The vote was unanimous. The students were excited they might enjoy Sarah’s class for once. After the session ended, one student, Katie Andrews, stopped by the teacher’s desk.
Katie: “Ms. Wilkins, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed our class today. Whatever happened, I hope will happen again next week!” 
Sarah thought “Me Too!”</Text>

            <Title>0142 Katie Loves Sarah’s Apartment</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah and Katie arrived at Sarah's apartment. Katie falls in love with the luxurious apartment. With Sarah now feeling Katie is a friend, she offers a delighted Katie use of guestroom anytime Katie needs a study sanctuary.</Synopsis>
            <Text>As they entered the upscale, modern apartment, Sarah and Katie naturally diverged. For Katie, unaccustomed to such luxury, the entire space was a marvel. She was entranced, her gaze traveling over the tastefully minimalist decor, pristine cleanliness, and the blend of modern furniture. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view of an untouched nature preserve in central Illinois—an unexpected gem, offering a green oasis laced with a shimmering creek.
&quot;Wow, Sarah, your place is amazing!&quot; Katie marveled, her voice slightly echoing in the vast space. She found herself gravitating toward the panoramic view, her footfalls soft against the gleaming hardwood floor.
In response, Sarah, already heading toward the kitchen, dismissively gestured with her hand. &quot;It's just home,&quot; she called back. &quot;Make yourself comfortable, Katie. Want something to drink? Coffee? Water? Or maybe a glass of wine?&quot;
Katie, still mesmerized by the vast preserve, turned at Sarah's words. &quot;Oh, I'd love some wine, but still a few years away,&quot; she said with a smirk. &quot;Better make it water.&quot;
Sarah let out a chuckle, &quot;Oh, I didn't even think about that,&quot; she admitted, her tone light and amused.
Katie said, &quot;You must be rich!&quot;
&quot;I'm not, but my father is. He owns a large corporation and pays the bills.&quot; Sarah explained as she finished pouring the drinks. She  gestured to the plush seating area that faced the scenic outdoors. &quot;Have a seat on the couch.&quot; 
Katie's youthful energy was infectious, her eyes wide with awe and excitement. &quot;Oh, my God! I love this place!&quot; Her voice rang out with pure delight, echoing around the room before she took an arm's open, playful back plunge onto the couch, her body sinking comfortably into its plush cushions. Her laughter filled the room, a joyful melody wrapped around them like a comforting blanket.
Holding a glass of chilled wine in one hand and a glass of water in the other, Sarah watched with a smile playing on her lips. She was amused by Katie's genuine delight, the vibrancy in the younger woman's eyes reflecting a life very different from her own. 
Sarah gracefully handed Katie the glass of water, then nestled into the other end of the couch, curling her legs underneath her. She held her glass of wine comfortably as she faced Katie, their eyes meeting in a silent agreement to embark on a girlish chat.</Text>

            <Notes>

Rewrite this paragraph. 
“A silence settled between them, dense and tangible. Sarah watched as Katie's gaze took another spin around the room before she extended a friendly hand. &quot;If you like, you can use my place if you need to study for a big test or just need some quiet time.&quot;”
Let’s have Sarah say something like “The guest rooms your to use anytime you need a study sanctuary!”
Sarah offers this to Katie, almost like a mother would offer her child a pony the child thought she could never have.

            <Title>0202 Patti Learns Evan Has a New Girlfriend</Title>
            <Synopsis>From the bleachers, Patti, Evan's most recent quasi-ex-girlfriend, watches Evan and Sarah meet in the parking lot. Guido and Sarah's best friend, Roxanne, tell Patti what they know and what they've heard about Sarah.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The cold aluminum bleachers under Patti's thighs bit through her jeans, an icy reminder of the chill in her heart. She sat, a picture of outward calm, staring at the parking lot. Evan and Sarah were there, laughter bubbling between them, the new doll he'd given her catching the sunlight. Every kiss, every giggle, was a punch in Patti's gut.
I thought I meant something to him, she reflected, her chest aching. How can he just move on so quickly?
Patti's mind raced back to her time with Evan, those days filled with laughter, comfort, and a connection she had never felt before. But as the memories tumbled through her mind, a rational voice emerged, grounding her in the reality of what had been. He never lied to me. He never called me his girlfriend. We were good friends, even before... before everything changed.
She thought of the way he'd introduced her to his sister, the way he'd looked at her, and how those months had lasted twice as long as any other girl he'd been with. But she knew in her heart that she had no right to be angry. Evan had been clear about his feelings, about his unusual monogamous but casual relationships. He hadn't deceived her; he'd been honest and caring. He always treated her well – as both a lover and a friend.
Her heart ached, but she reminded herself that Evan was still her good friend. She didn't want to lose that friendship, even though it hurt to see him with Sarah. A small smile tugged at her lips as she acknowledged that she still cared for him deeply, not just as a lover but as a friend.
He's not a bad guy, she reassured herself, her eyes on Evan in the parking lot. He just never felt about me the way I felt about him. And that's okay. It has to be okay.
Roxanne, seated beside her, followed her gaze and scowled. &quot;Look at that stuck-up snob,&quot; she spat. &quot;A rich bitch. I heard all about her.&quot;
Patti's eyes narrowed, but her voice was soft. &quot;She's very beautiful.&quot;
&quot;She doesn't hold a candle to you. You're twice as beautiful as her. Right, Guido?&quot; Roxanne demanded, turning to where Guido was warming up.
Guido glanced at them, his face neutral. &quot;I think they're both smoking hot! But you know Evan. Beauty is not his priority. He's all about 'chemistry.'&quot; His voice dripped with sarcasm as he threw the ball.
Roxanne's face twisted with anger, her arms waving animatedly. &quot;He should be with you, Patti. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it. Right, Guido?&quot;
&quot;I ain't saying nothing. I want no part of all your drama stuff.&quot; Guido's voice was firm as he turned away, dismissing the subject.
Patti's eyes were still on Evan and Sarah, a silent longing in her heart. Girlfriend? He never even called me his girlfriend.
&quot;Look at her, trying to look like one of us. She'll never be one of us. Look, she even bought a fucking book to read,&quot; Roxanne sneered, her words coated with venom.
Patti couldn't respond; her throat felt too tight. The reality of Evan's new relationship was crashing down on her, and she felt lost, adrift.
&quot;Shush! Here they come,&quot; she finally whispered, forcing herself to sit up straighter as Evan and Sarah approached.
&quot;It's nice to meet you all,&quot; Sarah's voice was sweet, her smile genuine.
Evan stood back with Sarah, quickly introducing Patti, Roxanne, Guido, and a few other friends. There was no handshakes, no hugs, just a hurried introduction before the game's call. Evan's eyes met Patti's for just a moment, but she looked away, the pain too fresh.
Conflicted between wanting to support Evan and welcome his new love into their inner circle, and feeling like a jilted ex-girlfriend, Patti forced a silent smile after the introduction.
Guido and Evan headed for the field, the call for the start of the game echoing across the park. The coldness of the bleachers seemed to seep into Patti's soul, leaving her feeling numb and alone.
As the game started, all she could think about was Evan's laughter, his joy with this new girl, and the word that kept echoing in her mind: Girlfriend?</Text>

            <Title>Evan Impresses</Title>
            <Text>Sarah's hand trembled as she grabbed the Bears tickets from the auction room table, glancing over her shoulder at the buzz of the ongoing event. Mr. Chamberlain said these were valuable and put them somewhere safe, she thought. Evan was mingling well, so she took the opportunity to run up to her room and put them in the hotel room safe.
As the door to her suite at the Grandeur Hotel swung open, she was taken aback by the breathtaking view of the city skyline, framed perfectly by floor-to-ceiling windows draped in sumptuous silk curtains. The room bathed in a gentle golden glow from the crystal chandeliers, and the rich mahogany furniture added a touch of elegance that reflected the evening's tone. She swiftly opened the safe and put the tickets inside, feeling a curious mixture of pride and uncertainty.
As she did, thoughts of Evan welled up within her. She had considered booking them in the same room but didn't feel ready yet. Would Evan be upset? she wondered, her heart aching at the thought. Could he understand why we must sleep in separate rooms?
Heading back to the bar, she was met with a knowing smile from Jenni, the bartender. The familiar clink of her favorite wine being poured was comforting.
“Your boy is doing pretty well out there,&quot; Jenni said, eyeing Evan as he chatted with Marcus.
Sarah's eyebrows shot up. She described how horrified she'd been when Evan approached Marcus with the casual attitude of an old friend, only to find that they bonded over football like they had been buddies for years.
&quot;Boys will be boys,&quot; Jenni laughed.
Sarah watched Evan going from group to group, shaking hands so often that it looked like he was at a square dancing competition. She mumbled to herself, &quot;I just don't get it!&quot;
“What do you mean?” Jenni asked.
&quot;Never mind, I was talking to myself,&quot; Sarah replied, brushing off the question. Yet Jenni's persistence led Sarah to open up, and she poured out her feelings.
She shared how she felt like an outsider with Evan's friends, how they spoke a different language. But here, Evan was thriving in her world, talking with Marcus like a college buddy, even receiving NFL tickets as a gift.
Jenni pointed out that Marcus, and likely many of the other esteemed guests, probably found Evan's approach refreshing. Unlike others who approached Marcus as an esteemed business leader, Evan had treated him like just one of the guys, as he would anyone he first met. This casual, genuine interaction was a breath of fresh air in a room filled with formality. Sarah was quiet for a moment, deep in thought, contemplating the uniqueness of Evan's approach.
“I don't think I can hold back anymore. I'm not sure I want to,” she said, her voice soft and full of realization. “I think Evan has melted my protective ice castle to the ground. Do you know how I am feeling about him right now?”
&quot;Impressed, inspired, dazzled?&quot; Jenni guessed.
Sarah laughed, her eyes shining. “Yes, all those things! But more than anything, it turns me on.”
Jenni burst into laughter, surprised by Sarah's revealing comment. &quot;Are you gonna do something about that?&quot;
&quot;I wish,&quot; Sarah sighed, looking at her watch. &quot;Dinner starts in about 10 minutes.&quot;
Jenni saw Sarah in deep thought and asked, &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;
&quot;What is a quarterback?&quot; Sarah blurted, causing Jenni to break out laughing.
Evan noticed Sarah at the bar, and after receiving a business card from a tech company owner, he headed over to see her. He showed her the card, excited about the opportunity.
Evan, feeling Sarah grab his hand and yank him toward the storage room, losing his balance slightly, managed to blurt out, &quot;Where are you taking me?&quot; His question was met with a sly grin from Sarah. &quot;The make-out room,&quot; she announced, her eyes dancing with mischief.
Evan's expression showed excitement, and when they reached the room, Sarah shut the door and pushed him against it. &quot;We only have five minutes, let's make it count!&quot; she exclaimed, leaning in and kissing him with great intensity and passion.
Their lips met, and the world outside ceased to exist. The kiss was a vivid testament to their connection, to the barriers broken and the newfound intimacy they shared. It was the taste of commitment, of letting go, and of embracing love, even if it was meant to last only for a season.</Text>

Scene Name: Evan Has a Special Gift Made
Summary: At the mall, looking for a special gift for his date with Sarah, Evan stumbles upon a unique idea that symbolizes their first meeting. He commissions a jeweler to craft a necklace featuring a pendant of silver-coated toy glasses, encapsulating the memory and adding a personal touch to their budding relationship.
Characters: Guido, Jewelry Store Owner
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Location: A Local Mall
Tone: Anxious, excited, anticipatory, intense/focused
Weather: Not relevant for this scene
Special Instructions: 
In the sequence of events section, I provide some ideas of what might be done and spoken. You have full discretion to write this scene the way you feel works best.
Summary:
Evan headed to the mall to look for a special piece of jewelry that he could buy as a gift given to Sarah on their first date. He didn’t know what he was looking for, but he felt confident that he will find something special. 
He went from jewelry store to jewelry store and jewelry department to jewelry department of chain stores – without any luck. Just about to give up, he came upon a small privately owned jewelry store located in a somewhat hidden corner of the mall.
He saw something interesting he had never seen before. It was  a display case with tiny glass slippers– averaging about 3 to 4 inches in width.
He walked in and talked to the owner about the glass slippers. The jewelry store owner explained that people collect these tiny glass slippers and put them in a curio cabinet at home or on display somewhere. They are simply ornamental knickknacks.
The reason that the glass slippers caught Evan's eye is because he always calls Sarah, Cinderella. He thought, maybe the glass slippers were a sign. Feeling inspired, but not feeling like that was the right gift, he started looking through the necklaces on display. A light bulb popped in his head.
He thought about how bookworms and sunglass wearers often have a chain or some device that attaches to the arms of the glasses and goes around the neck, so the glasses won't fall off.
He thought how perfect that would be. Sarah didn't leave the glass slipper behind, but she did leave her glasses behind. So, he thought if he got a necklace with tiny little glasses as the charm that hung on the necklace, that would be a unique and special gift with meaning that will last forever. 
Unfortunately, the small store didn't have any necklaces with glasses as a charm.
Evan headed back and scoured every jewelry store he could find with no sign of anything close to what he wanted.
Feeling disappointed, he was about new the mall and seek out similar jewelry stores when he passed by a vintage toy store. In the window, he saw and old-fashioned doll that wearing tiny little glasses.
His frown turned upside down immediately. He couldn't be more excited and ran to the store and purchased the doll. His idea was to buy a silver necklace and is somehow attached the necklace to the doll's glasses.
He went back to the small jewelry store and ask the owner if he could help him attach necklace to toy glasses.
The owner told him he could do it, but it wouldn't last long. It would probably break in the first week. Momentarily feeling down again in the roller coaster of a gift-finding journey, the owner suggested that Evan coded in sterling silver. Small eyehooks can be attached to it which any silver chain could grab onto. 
Evan asked the jeweler if that's something he could get done by Thursday morning.
Normally the jeweler would make a customer wait two weeks for a custom order like this, but he could see how excited Evan was (Evan had told him the story at some point). The jeweler couldn't deny young love, it was a small job anyway, he told Evan to come back the next day, which was Wednesday, and it would be ready half an hour before close.
Evan nervously asked him how much it would cost and was pleasantly surprised that even with the purchase of a silver chain it was well within his budget.
The scene will end with Evan feeling great as he leaves the jewelry store certain that he had found the most special gift he could have possibly even thought of. He was certain that Sarah was going to be pleasantly surprised.

What role does this setting play in the story? 
This location plays a vital role because this is where Evan and Sarah have their first kiss—affectionately known as &quot;The Kiss&quot; by Evan's friends and family. Sarah was rushing to class and wasn't paying attention to her surroundings. She was seconds away and falling down the stairs, but then Evan swooped in to save her, and they kissed in the heat of the moment.
Description: 
Not far from the library’s exit are four concrete steps leading downward. It's important to note that the railings for these concrete steps are few and far between. The staircase itself is over 40 feet wide. If one is not paying attention, it would be easy to take a hard fall on the concrete steps, where a railing may be too far away to spirit someone the fall.</Text>

            <Title>Plot Summaries</Title>
            <Notes>For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his nurturing sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy. 
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments. 
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz. 
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds, listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally. 
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything. 
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls. 
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs. 
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss. 
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire. 
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career. 
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age. 
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number. 
A few days later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself. 
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break. 
At the food court, Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car. 
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment. 
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews. 
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart. 
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class. 
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations. Just one week after the first kiss, Evan and Sarah were romantic partners.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan. 
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss. 
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together. 
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel. 
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit. 
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him. 
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals. 
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago. 
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person. 
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle. 
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s unshakable bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan. 
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.

Scene Title: Evan Gives Sarah the Vintage Doll
Summary: 
An eager Evan meets Sarah near her car before a game, handing her the vintage doll she wanted. Seeing she brought a book with her, he assures her it's fine to study during the game. To his amusement, she pulls out &quot;Softball for Dummies,&quot; lightening the mood and showing her commitment to enjoying their time together.
Characters:
Evan: Evan waits for Sarah in the softball field parking lot. He gifts her the vintage doll. 
Sarah: Per their agreement, Sarah arrives at Evan's softball game. She brings the book titled &quot;Softball for Dummies.&quot; 
Location: Large recreation area in central Illinois.
Setting: Parking lot adjacent to the softball field.
Time and Day: Sunday morning
Weather: Partly sunny, a typical crisp, cool morning in early fall in central Illinois. It's too early for the leaves change color.
Emotional Tone:  Sweet, sentimental, young love is in the air, Humor 
Backstory: 
Last Thursday evening marked the beginning of Evan and Sarah's formal relationship, solidified by a pact that resembled a contract. They outlined commitments to one another, with Sarah agreeing to attend as many of Evan's Sunday morning softball games as possible.
The evening was made even more special when Evan presented Sarah with an extraordinary gift. Finding a vintage doll adorned with tiny glasses, he enlisted a jeweler to coat the glasses in silver and fashion them into a pendant for a beautiful necklace. The sentiment of the gift resonated deeply with Sarah. She was so enamored with the unique creation that she requested to keep the vintage doll. Her request further bonded their newly forged connection.
Before meeting Evan, Sarah's wardrobe consisted mainly of business suits and designer gowns. Casual clothing was foreign to her. That was about to change when she befriended Katie, one of her Business-101 students. With the aid of her hairstylist Nicole, Katie gave Sarah a complete makeover for her date with Evan.
Sarah shared with Katie the unique contract-style relationship with Evan, including her commitments to attend his softball games and college parties, a stark contrast to her usual upscale philanthropic events.
Wanting to help Sarah blend in with Evan's friends and the college crowd, Katie and Sarah embarked on a shopping spree the Saturday before the softball game. The outing was a success, and Sarah's closet became fully equipped with the casual clothes typical of college students, symbolizing a transformation not just in her appearance but in her life's direction.
Another critical point to understand in this scene is that Sarah clarified that academics always come first in this scene, which leads to a funny moment. However, it also shows how Evan fully supports Sarah's academic priorities.
Scene Conclusion: 
The scene ends as they head toward the bleachers, where Evan will introduce Sarah to his inner circle group of friends.

[[ Sarah opens her car door and grabs a book. ]]
Sarah: &quot;Evan, do you mind if I read a book during your game?&quot;
[[ Evan smiles warmly and supportively. ]]
Evan: &quot;Of course, I don't mind. Our games can last as long as two hours, and I fully support and understand that your academics are your number one priority. I'm nothing but grateful that you're coming to my games. I know we just met, but for some reason, it feels like such an important thing. So yes, schoolbook and study material you need for any game.&quot;
[[ Sarah laughs, as she knows that Evan is unaware of the book’s title. This leads to a funny and sweet moment. ]]
[[ Sarah giggles. She feigns seriousness. ]]
Sarah: &quot;That's good to know; maybe I'll need to bring some study materials one day. But this book is not about academics.”
[[ She smiled widely and showed Evan the front of the book. It's titled Softball for Dummies. 
This causes a hearty laugh from both Sarah and Evan.  ]]
Sarah: “I don't know anything about sports. If I'm going to come to games, I want to understand them as best as I can.”
Evan: “You are so adorable!” 
[[ Sarah has never been called adorable by anyone. Endorphins flow. ]]
Evan: &quot;The game is about to start. Let’s go.&quot;
[[ Sarah's nervousness shows in her eyes and body language. ]]
Sarah:  “I think I need a kiss.&quot;
I will leave it to your discretion if she's asking for the kiss as a dose of encouragement or if she tells Evan she needs a kiss for encouragement. ]]

Title: Sarah Impresses
Summary:
Evan waited briefly in The Grandeur's lavish lobby near Chicago's O'Hare airport. A text from Sarah guided him to the grand ballroom, where he found her coordinating a nonprofit event. Witnessing her in her element for the first time, he was impressed and utterly captivated by her skill.
Setting:
Location: The Grandeur Hotel. The scene starts in the lobby and finishes in the grand ballroom.
Time: Early evening
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Evan and Sarah
Secondary Characters: Jenni, Female Bartender in her 30s
Character Emotional State:
Evan: Nervous, Excited, Optimistic
Sarah: Busy, Excited
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Evan)
Dialogue Focus: Minimal
Use of Internal Dialogue: Heavy
Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
Evan sat in the lobby of The Grandeur Hotel, waiting for Sarah to text him, letting him know where he was to meet her.
Evan receives Sarah's tax instructing him to go to The Grand Ballroom on the third floor and wait for her at the open bar. 
She tells him to order whatever he wants to drink because she has a hotel room booked for him, so he doesn't have to worry about driving while intoxicated.
Evan makes his way to the opulent hallways and lavish gold-colored elevators.
Eventually, he makes it to The Grand Ballroom, big enough to accommodate hundreds of dining guests.
He scanned the room, looking for Sarah.
Sarah was easy to spot. A tall blonde in a designer dress bouncing around the room like a ping-pong ball.
Evan was captivated by watching her inner natural habitat. Besides him, she was by far the youngest person in the room, yet she was clearly in charge.
He watched her for a few minutes as she must've spoken to every staff member in the room.
She directed them and precisely instructed what and when she needed it done.
Middle:
As Evan headed to the bar, he pondered what he should order at an event like this. He doesn't like wine much, and a beer seemed out of place.
Jenni was a woman in her 30’s. Evan felt like she was someone he could talk to. 
Evan approached the bar.
Jenni: &quot;First time event like this?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Is it that obvious?&quot;
Jenni: &quot;A little bit. But Sarah told me you'd be coming. I'm going to guess that your Evan.&quot; 
Evan (laughed): &quot;That I am.&quot;
Jenni: &quot;Sarah vouched for your age, so I won't bug you for an ID. What's your poison?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I have no idea what to order at a place like this. I don't want wine or beer. Any suggestions?&quot;
Jenni smiles and whips up a drink for Evan.
Jenni: &quot;This'll help loosen up your nerves, but I would take it slow.&quot;
Evan: &quot;What's in it?&quot;
Jenni: &quot;Sarah tells me year in college. Although the drinks are free here, I figured I'd make you something you can afford when you return home. It's a Jack and Coke.&quot;
Evan takes a small sip.
Evan: &quot;I like it!&quot;
Jenni: &quot;I thought you might. Just take it easy there, college boy. You don't want to embarrass Sarah on her big night.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Have you known Sarah long?&quot;
Jenni: &quot;For about a year. I'm her first choice to tend bar for her fundraisers. She's a great boss.&quot;
Evan: &quot;She is?&quot;
Jenni: &quot;Don't get me wrong, she is tough. She makes it clear what she expects if you don't deliver your out. She doesn't take crap from anyone. But if you're good at your job, do what she asks of you without any attitude, she treats you well and makes sure that you get paid well.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I had no idea. I've been amazed watching her bounce around the room.&quot;
Jenni: &quot;That girl is versatile. Once the party starts, she works the room like a pro.&quot;
Evan laughs.
Evan: &quot;I'm not sure what that means.&quot;
Jenni laughs.
Jenni: &quot;It means she knows how to squeeze the dollars out of even the stingiest misers. I'm glad she'll have someone beside her tonight to stave off the wolves.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Wolves?&quot;
Jenni: &quot;Don't get me wrong, Sarah can hold her own with anyone in the room. She finds a way to shoo them away while still getting them to empty their pocketbooks through donations or overpaying on auction items.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Who does shoo away?&quot;
Jenni laughs loudly.
Jenni: &quot;About half the you guys are going to see tonight. Mostly older men, half of the married.&quot;
Jenni could see Evan's face worry.
Jenni: &quot;Don't worry, their money doesn't impress Sarah. She may let them think they have a shot with her, but she always keeps it professional. She's a pro.&quot;
Evan: &quot;So you telling me I don't have anything to worry about?&quot;
Jenni: &quot;You have nothing to worry about! Sarah's not one to share details of her personal life, but when she mentioned you were coming to the event, her face lit up in a way I've never seen before.&quot;
End: 
The two continued to chat for a while.
Sarah eventually looks over the bar and sees Evan.
She put up her index finger, signaling she'll be there in one minute.
Sarah arrives at the bar.
Jenni says to Sarah: &quot;The usual?&quot;
Sarah nods.
Jenni serves up some wine.
Gives Evan a welcoming, gentle hug.
Objectives/Goals:
We want the readers to see that while Sarah may seem an introvert to peers her age, she is anything but a shy introvert when she is in her world.
She's a strong, business-minded woman, using her skills to benefit nonprofit organizations.
While even in her world, she doesn't make a lot of friends, she is well respected by everyone that she works for.
Her reputation for rejecting all salacious propositions from even the wealthiest men has earned her the respect of the staff, Volunteers, and genuinely benevolent wealthy people.
We also want to show how Evan sees Sarah in a whole different light, and as the night progresses, everything he sees will confirm what he already knows, he is in love with her.
Props/Items:
Bar

Special Instructions/Notes:
Provide a vivid description of the fictional Grandeur Hotel. Please describe in vivid detail a five-star hotel dripping in extravagance, opulence, and luxury.
As Evan walks through the hallways to the elevator, use deep POV and internal dialogue to help the reader experience what Evan's experiencing. He's never been to a place like this and is in awe.
Find area in the scene as well to describe the grand ballroom. However, the next scene will be in the grand ballroom, so you don't have to be as detailed. Fit it in as naturally as possible.

Scene Template:
Title: Liz Meets Sarah for the First Time
Summary:
Evan and Sarah visit Liz's house for a three-day holiday, marking Liz's first introduction to Sarah. Joined by Liz's boyfriend, Joe, the four enjoy a home-cooked dinner together. The atmosphere is warm and cheerful, filled with lively conversation and laughter as they become better acquainted, turning strangers into friends over the course of the meal.
Leading Context:
It's Christmas Eve. Evan is bringing homes to meet Liz and her boyfriend Joe for the first time. Because of Sarah's busy role as events coordinator for nonprofit organizations, her holiday break from school carries a heavy workload. With Evan helping her, they were only able to squeeze in time for a three-day trip to Chicago.
Setting:
Location: Joe and Liz's apartment in Glenview, Illinois. A northern suburb of Chicago.
Time: The scene takes place from approximately 5 o'clock in the evening until dinner was complete.
Weather/Environment: Frigid cold in windy outside – a typical winter day in Chicago. It's dry and cold and this day, but Liz hopes for snow the following day on Christmas.
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Liz, Joe, Sarah, Evan
Secondary Characters: None
Character Emotional State:
Liz:Liz: Liz was excited to see her younger brother, as always. They shared a close, loving bond, and she missed him, having not seen him since early in the summer. Liz was particularly excited this trip because she finally got to meet Sarah, the girl Evan called &quot;the one.&quot;
Joe: Joe's emotional state was neutral. He and Evan got along well. Overall, his feelings were neutral, but he was happy to see how joyful Liz was as she prepared food for the evening.
Evan: Evan was extremely excited. While he loved his sister, missed her, and looked forward to seeing her, his real excitement lay in introducing Sarah to Liz for the first time.
Sarah: Sarah's emotional state was primarily neutral. She was not nervous about meeting Liz, but she had a busy workload she was itching to get back to. Had it been her choice, she would have stayed in Champaign and attended to her event coordinator duties. But Evan wanted to come home for a few days and introduce her to his sister. Sarah's primary motivation to join him had nothing to do with the holidays, but rather her feeling obligated to her boyfriend.
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Liz)

            <Title>0225 Sarah Impresses</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan waited briefly in The Grandeur's lavish lobby near Chicago's O'Hare airport. A text from Sarah guided him to the grand ballroom, where he found her coordinating a nonprofit event. Witnessing her in her element for the first time, he was more than impressed; he was utterly captivated by her skill.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan sat in the lavish lobby of The Grandeur Hotel, his heart racing with both excitement and nerves. The surroundings dripped with opulence, from the sparkling chandeliers to the plush velvet furniture. He glanced at his phone, anticipating Sarah's instructions.
A text buzzed in, guiding him to the open bar of he Grand Ballroom on the third floor. His eyes widened at her consideration - his own hotel room, free drinks, no concerns about driving.
He made his way through the opulent hallways, eyes widening at the sheer luxury of it all. Gold-colored elevators carried him to the grand ballroom, large enough to host hundreds of dining guests. His eyes scanned the room, finally landing on Sarah.
There she was, tall and blonde, bouncing around the room, directing staff with authority and grace. He was captivated, seeing her in her element.
I've never seen her like this. She's incredible.
He approached the bar, uncertainty tugging at him. The bartender, Jenni, a woman in her 30s, seemed approachable, her smile warm and friendly.
&quot;First time at an event like this?&quot; she asked.
&quot;Is it that obvious?&quot; Evan replied.
&quot;A little bit. But Sarah told me you'd be coming. I’m Jenni. I'm going to guess that you're Evan.&quot; 
&quot;That I am,&quot; he laughed.
&quot;Sarah vouched for your age, so I won't bug you for an ID. What's your poison?&quot;
&quot;I have no idea what to order at a place like this. I don't want wine or beer. Any suggestions?&quot; Evan admitted.
Jenni's smile widened as she whipped up a drink. &quot;This'll help loosen up your nerves, but I would take it slow.&quot;
&quot;What's in it?&quot; he asked curiously.
&quot;Sarah tells me you're in college. Although the drinks are free here, I figured I'd make you something you can afford when you return home. It's a Jack and Coke.&quot;
Evan took a small sip, his eyes lighting up. &quot;I like it!&quot;
&quot;I thought you might. Just take it easy there, college boy. You don't want to embarrass Sarah on her big night.&quot;
&quot;Have you known Sarah long?&quot; he asked, intrigued.
&quot;For about a year. I'm her first choice to tend bar for her fundraisers. She's a great boss.&quot;
&quot;She is?&quot;
&quot;Don't get me wrong, she is tough. She makes it clear what she expects; if you don't deliver, you're out. She doesn't take crap from anyone. But if you're good at your job, do what she asks of you without any attitude, she treats you well and makes sure that you get paid well.&quot;
&quot;I had no idea. I've been amazed watching her bounce around the room,&quot; Evan said, admiration in his voice.
&quot;That girl is versatile. Once the party starts, she works the room like a pro.&quot;
Evan laughed, intrigued. &quot;I'm not sure what that means.&quot;
Jenni laughed in return. &quot;It means she knows how to squeeze the dollars out of even the stingiest misers. I'm glad she'll have someone beside her tonight to stave off the wolves.&quot;
&quot;Wolves?&quot; Evan asked, concern creeping in.
&quot;Don't get me wrong, Sarah can hold her own with anyone in the room. She finds a way to shoo them away while still getting them to empty their pocketbooks through donations or overpaying on auction items.&quot;
&quot;Who does she shoo away?&quot; Evan asked, fascination growing.
Jenni laughed loudly. &quot;About half the guys you're going to see tonight. Mostly older men, some of them married.&quot;
Her laughter died down as she saw Evan's worried expression. &quot;Don't worry, their money doesn't impress Sarah. She may let them think they have a shot with her, but she always keeps it professional. She's a pro.&quot;
&quot;So you're telling me I don't have anything to worry about?&quot; he asked, hope in his eyes.
&quot;You have nothing to worry about! Sarah's not one to share details of her personal life, but when she mentioned you were coming to the event, her face lit up in a way I've never seen before.&quot;
The words sank into Evan's heart, solidifying what he already felt deep down.
She cares about me. And I'm in love with her.
They continued to chat until Sarah spotted Evan and approached the bar. Her eyes twinkled with excitement, and her smile warmed his soul.
&quot;The usual?&quot; Jenni asked Sarah, who nodded.
As Jenni served up Sarah's wine, she gave Evan a welcoming, gentle hug, a silent promise of a beautiful night ahead. They exchanged smiles, and Evan knew, without a doubt, that he was where he was meant to be.</Text>

            <Text>Closes to my original:
Refrain from adding new lines of dialogue unless absolutely necessary for coherence or character development. I'd like the narrative to weave seamlessly around the original dialogue, providing connective tissue between the lines of speech rather than introducing new plot points or revelations.

Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. While the narrative description is important for setting the scene and expressing the characters' internal thoughts, I prefer a heavier emphasis on dialogue to carry the scene forward. Allow the characters' words and interactions to reveal their personalities and the nuances of the situation.
Prioritize My dialogue:
Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. I'm particularly interested in maintaining the authentic voice of my characters and the specific flow of the conversation.
Add Depth to Dialogue:
Please ensure the scene is not dominated by dialogue. Integrate some narrative description and action into the dialogue to add depth and create a more dynamic scene. Avoid having many lines of dialogue without any breaks in between. Keep the characters 'doing' things while they're talking, making the scene more lively and engaging.


* Conclude each scene with an evocative image or action that naturally implies an end or transition, without explicitly stating the scene is ending.
To have all of your scenes written in the style of Nicholas Sparks, you can include the following instruction in your custom instructions:
&quot;Please write all scenes in the style of Nicholas Sparks. Infuse each scene with emotional depth, heartfelt descriptions, and a touch of romantic intrigue. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the characters' emotions and surroundings. Capture the essence of tender beauty and poetic language in each narrative. Ensure that the scenes evoke a strong emotional response and resonate with the reader on an emotional level.&quot;
Please preserve my original dialogue as much as possible. It's important that the dialogue serves as the primary driver of the scene. Use narrative description primarily to supplement the dialogue, providing context, mood, and introspection, but not steering the main course of events.
Use the narrative to enhance the existing dialogue, emphasizing character emotions, internal thoughts, and the setting as necessary. However, ensure the dialogue remains the central mechanism for moving the plot forward.
Integrate dialogue tags an action tags at your full discretion. 
Remove all speaker labels identified by the character name followed by a colon and a space. Example &quot;Sarah: &quot;

Please prioritize 'showing' over 'telling' in this scene. I'd like the narrative to convey emotions, actions, and settings through descriptive language, character interactions, and dialogue, rather than directly stating them. Aim to make the scene vivid and immersive, allowing readers to infer and visualize details.&quot; </Text>

Scene Name: Evan and Guido in the Quad
Summary: Evan and Guido enjoy a game of Frisbee in the Quad, their laughter filling the air. Amidst the fun, Evan's mind turns to his academics. Reminded of the promise he made to his sister Liz to maintain a GPA above 3.0, he makes a decision to cut their game short and head to the library for some extra study time.

POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Location: The “Quad” At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
Time of Day: Morning
Tone: Humorous
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
Although the scene is meant to be humorous and lighthearted, it is important for the reader to understand that Evan takes his promises to his sister Liz seriously. His sister is very important to him and he never want to disappoint her.
This is optional information to use or not use as you please. Evan and Guido often engage in &quot;good-natured ribbing.&quot;
If Evan's academic prowess is mentioned, the reader should understand, that Evan is no genius, nor is he a dumb athlete. He is above average in intelligence, but his lack of enthusiasm for the classroom environment and homework assignments prevents him from getting better grades. It is not a requirement that you mention any of these, but if you do I wanted the reader to understand.
Sequence of Events:
Provide a vivid description of “The Quad.” Be sure to include the perfect weather conditions. We want to give the reader a good high-energy feel about this perfect day.
Evan and Guido are playing Frisbee in the Quad. Evan decides to head to the library for extra study time to keep his grade point average above 3.0 – a promise he made to his sister Liz. His didn’t fear Liz. Liz is quite nurturing, and his motivation for keeping his promise wants to honor his promise and make her proud. Be subtle about this.
This scene should end as Evan leaves the Quad. Don't get him to close to the library in this scene. 
Include dialogue in this scene.

Leading Context:
In the preceding scene, Evan declared his love for Sarah, reassuring her that he would patiently wait for her to be ready before they made love. He emphasized that he wanted her to verbally express her love only when all her fears and doubts had vanished. Contentment in his heart and a smile on his lips, he then headed to his room, the memory of their sensual goodnight kiss still lingering on his mind.

[ Sarah got out of the tub, towel-dried her hair, and put on a fluffy luxurious white robe provided by the hotel. ]
As Sarah rushed her teeth, and blow dry her hair, her thoughts shifted to Evan's final words to her before heading to his room. He had sold Sarah, that he would wait an eternity to make love to her, if that's how much time she needed.

While she waited for room service, she wrote on a small notepad.  She tore the note off the pad and placed it into an envelope. 
Sarah then went to her purse, and grabbed an item from the person and placed it in the envelope, along with the note, and then sealed the envelope.
Finally she wrote on the envelope, &quot;Evan&quot; with a heart next to his name.
[ A knock on the door got Sarah's attention. Sarah grabbed the envelope and a $20 bill and headed to her hotel room door. ]
She smiled at the staff member, handed her the envelope and the $20 tip, told her Evan's room number, and asked her to slip the envelope underneath his door.
The staff member smiled back, having a pretty good idea of what was in the envelope and confirm she was on her way to deliver the envelope.

Title: Evan and A Few Friends Volunteer
Summary:
Evan gathered Guido, Patti, Roxanne, and friends to volunteer for cleaning debris in central Illinois following a tornado. Sarah took the helm as the lead event coordinator, working for the nonprofit organization &quot;Home Is Where the Heart Is.&quot; Together, they turned a time of devastation into a period of community and healing, all working towards restoring the farmlands.
Leading Context:
In an earlier chapter, at a fundraiser EVENT organized by Sarah, Evan had met the founder, Marcus Chamberlain,  of the nonprofit organization &quot;Home Is Where the Heart Is.&quot; Marcus asked if Evan was interested in volunteering for an upcoming project. The project involved cleanup after a tornado had ripped through the farmlands of central Illinois a few weeks 
prior.
Not only did Evan enthusiastically agree to volunteer his time, he told Marcus he intended to recruit a handful of his close friends to volunteer their Saturday as well.
Grateful for Evan's offer, Marcus offered to pull Chicago Bears football tickets out of the auction, and give the four football tickets to Evan if he was able to recruit his friends, especially Guido.
The humor in that scene was in regards to Evan explaining that he can get Guido to volunteer his time, as long as there were adult single women at the event and a six-pack of beer awaited him(Guido) after a job well done.
This scene picks up on a Saturday, two weeks after the fundraising event.
Setting:
Location: Farmlands of central Illinois
Time: The scene started in the morning on a Saturday, and ended at sunset the same day.
Weather/Environment: Typical partly sunny, chilly fall day in central Illinois.
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Sarah, Marcus, Evan, Guido
Secondary Characters: Katie, Patti, Roxanne, and other volunteers
Character Emotional State:
Evan and his friends: Energized
Sarah: Neutral. Sarah had attended many such events. Her role was always as either lead event coordinator, or assistant event coordinator. Today was just business as usual for Sarah. Her role was to make sure the days activities went smoothly, and that the volunteers were all fed and cared for properly.

            <Title>0123 Sarah Can't Concentrate</Title>
            <Text>The Undergraduate Library was abuzz with the clatter of keystrokes, the murmur of hushed conversations, and the low hum of fluorescent lights overhead. It was a cocoon of industry, a hive of collegiate life, and its energy was as palpable as it was contagious. Groups of students huddled around tables, their brows furrowed in concentration, their voices a soft chatter. In the corners, amidst the maze of books, the library also nurtured tentative friendships and budding flirtations.
Yet, today, for Sarah, the lively hum and vibrant buzz were background noise. She was elsewhere, trapped in her thoughts, her mind a whirlpool of images and sensations, all converging on one moment – the kiss.
Sarah had always been a disciplined student. She prided herself on her ability to block out distractions, to focus, to absorb the information that swam across the pages in front of her. But today, every line she read, every fact she tried to internalize, it all blurred into an indistinguishable mass, drowned out by the memory of a unexpected kiss.
Why is this happening to me? Sarah wondered. She nervously fidgeted with her glasses, cleaning the lenses more out of habit than necessity. But the lenses weren't the problem. It was the relentless film that played on the screen of her mind, a replay of an unexpected, yet passionately heart-stopping kiss.
In an attempt to shake off her mental fog, she started to tidy her work area. Pens were aligned, notebooks stacked, eraser bits brushed away. She picked up her purse and methodically checked its contents, putting everything back in a precise order.
In the back of her mind, the logical part of her brain told her to snap out of it, to regain her focus. It reminded her of her vow to keep romantic entanglements at bay. But the other part, the part that seemed to be in control today, yearned for more. More of the mystery man, more of his touch, more of the sparks that had ignited between them.
I have to get back to my work, she admonished herself as she roamed the aisles aimlessly, her fingers running over the spines of books she had no intention of reading. 
The tension was building, a mix of frustration and yearning. In a small act of surrender to her distracted state, she gathered her hair, twisting it into a bun at the top of her head. It was an unconscious act, an echo of countless study sessions in the past.
Is this what attraction to the masculine feels like? Sarah mused, her heart pounding a little faster as the memory of the kiss washed over her again. How does a woman get any work done? 
Sarah, the diligent student, the disciplined scholar, was facing a new challenge. It wasn't an academic hurdle or an intellectual puzzle. It was something far more uncontrollable, far more overwhelming. It was desire. And she was lost in it, unable to find her way back to the safety of her books. For the first time in her academic career, she was grateful for her habitual over-preparedness. But even that relief was fleeting, swept away by a new wave of memories and longing. 
She was no longer just Sarah, the focused student, the valedictorian. She was Sarah, the woman yearning for a man's touch, Sarah, who craved for just one more kiss. It was a struggle, an internal tug-of-war that left her reeling and distracted. The library, once a sanctuary of knowledge, had become the stage for her emotional unrest, a symbol of the turmoil within her. And she had no idea how to handle it.</Text>

Title: Sarah Preps Evan
Summary:
In a private storage room, Sarah briefs Evan for an upcoming fundraiser, exuding a mix of enthusiasm and worry. She urges him to be mindful, especially around her boss, Marcus Chamberlain, who looks like Morgan Freeman. Her instructions, imbued with belief in Evan and anxiety about the night, set the scene for what seems to be a memorable event.
Leading Context:
This scene follows the last scene, where Evan is waiting at the open bar in the grand ballroom, talking to the bartender, Jenni,  while Sarah finishes checking that everything is going as planned.
The previous scene ended with Jenni serving Sarah a glass of wine and giving Evan a gentle hug.
Setting:
Location: The Grand Ballroom at the Grandeur Hotel
Time: 7 PM to 10 PM
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Sarah, Evan
Secondary Characters: Various philanthropists at the event
Character Emotional State:
Evan: Nervous, Excited, Optimistic
Sarah: Busy, Excited
Clothing:
Evan: Evan wore a well-fitted charcoal gray suit, a smart choice that looked more expensive than its cost. The jacket's subtle lines and single-breasted design complemented his build. Underneath, he wore a soft blue dress shirt that added a touch of sophistication. His maroon tie, adorned with a modern and appealing pattern, provided a stylish contrast, adding flair and sophistication to his ensemble. The outfit was finished with polished black leather shoes, laced perfectly. Though purchased on a budget, the suit gave Evan a refined appearance, suitable for the elegant fundraiser event. It was a visual testament to his effort to fit into Sarah's world.
Sarah: Sarah's dress was a vibrant turquoise evening gown, tailored to accentuate her grace. The luxurious silk blend shimmered in the ballroom's light, while a fitted bodice with a modest sweetheart neckline adorned with intricate lace added a touch of elegance. A thin diamond belt highlighted her slender figure, leading to a flowing chiffon skirt. The back featured a tasteful keyhole opening, fastened with a delicate button, and a gentle train. Simple diamond studs and a silver bracelet completed her ensemble, reflecting her strong yet graceful personality, perfect for navigating the upscale event.

Beginning: 
[ Begin the scene with Evan and Sarah complimenting each other on their appearance. I have provided a clothing description that should be used in this scene at the beginning. ]
[ After Evan and Sarah exchanged compliments, she grabbed her glass of wine from the bar. ]
Middle: 
Sarah: &quot;Come on, Evan. Let's go talk somewhere privately.&quot;
[ Evan followed Sarah to a small storage room located behind the coat check room.  ]
[ She closed the door behind them. ]
Evan: &quot;Is this the make-out room?&quot;
[ He said with the energy of a teenager in love as he leaned in for a kiss. ]
[ Sarah spoke In a low voice close to a whisper. ]
Sarah: &quot;Not here. This is my work. We have to keep a professional.&quot; 
[ Evan was not bothered at all by Sarah's comment. ]
Evan: &quot;Why are we whispering? There's no one here.&quot;
[ Sarah laughed before speaking at a normal volume level.]
Sarah: &quot;I have no idea.&quot;
[ They both laughed. ]
Sarah: &quot;I brought you back here because I wanted to prep you for the fundraiser. I should've done this earlier, but I just got so busy.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Prep away!&quot;
Sarah: &quot;Well, first, tell me how you're feeling. Are you nervous?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I was extremely nervous when I left my apartment. I decided to call Liz on the two-hour drive to Chicago. She reminded me that no matter how wealthy or sophisticated a person is, they still put on the pants one leg at a time. They still sneeze, burp, cough, cry, and laugh. She also told me that, most importantly, rich or poor, the best people prioritize authenticity. If they don't like me for who I am, then I should simply, as Liz calls it, 'exit gracefully.'&quot;  
Sarah: &quot;And that's all it took to calm your nerves?&quot;
[ Evan, ever the comic. ]
Evan: &quot;Well, that and a little help from my friend Jack Daniels that your bartender introduced me to.&quot; 
[ Sarah and Evan both laughed. Then Sarah got her serious business look on her face. ]
Sarah: &quot;This fundraising event is for the nonprofit 'Home Is Where the Heart Is.' It was founded by a very wealthy businessman and gentleman named Marcus Chamberlain – think Morgan Freeman's twin brother.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Gotcha!&quot;
Sarah: &quot;This is the third event I've organized for him. I like working for him because he's not a jerk and gives me the autonomy to do the job right. He is quite distinguished, so be on your best behavior around him.&quot;
[ Evan repeats the critical components of words to help him remember. ]
Evan: &quot;Marcus Chamberlain, Home Is Where the Heart Is, best behavior.&quot;
Evan: &quot;What will the funds raised tonight be used for?&quot;
Sarah: &quot;Home Is Where the Heart Is provides funds and volunteers to help low-income families rehab homes in disrepair. They also help rebuild uninsured or underinsured homes lost due to fire or natural disaster.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Wow! Those are good causes.&quot;
Sarah: &quot;Yes, it is. I hope to top last year's record for this annual fundraising event.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Who else do I need to know about? The bartender said I may have to defend you against some salacious wolves?&quot;
[Evan humorously jumped into a boxer’s pose with his dukes held high, causing Sarah to laugh. ]
Sarah: &quot;Just having you by my side will spook them away. It will be nice not to have to deal with them for once.&quot;
[ Sarah looked at her watch. ]
Sarah: &quot;We're out of time. Look, do your best. Don't be offended or surprised if a bunch of people try to get you to donate money. Since no one knows you, they may think you're a trust fund kid and see you as fresh meat.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Can I get a kiss before we head out into the den of wolves?&quot;
[ For reasons unknown to Evan but he finds amusing, he sees Sarah look left then right in a small room with a closed door. He thinks she's being a bit paranoid. ]
Sarah: &quot;Alight, one quick kiss, that's it.&quot;
[ Sarah leaned in, and true to her word Evan got a quick kiss, and that was it. ]
End: 
[ Sarah opened the door, peeked her head out, and looked both ways. With the coast clear, she and Evan walked down the hall toward The Grand Ballroom. ]
[ As they reached the edge of the grand ballroom, illuminated by the soft glow of crystal chandeliers and filled with the murmur of elegant conversations, Evan turned to Sarah with an air of traditional gallantry. His eyes met hers, and with a slight, gentlemanly bow, he extended his arm toward her. Understanding the timeless gesture, Sarah gracefully slipped her arm into his, allowing her hand to rest just above his elbow. With arms interlocked, they ventured into the mystery of the evening ahead. ]
Objectives/Goals:
Earlier chapter, we see that Sarah is a bit uptight. She's too nervous to make out with Evan in the storage room and worries about his interaction with her boss, Marcus Chamberlain.
Note that by the end of the chapter, Sarah is no longer uptight and realizes she never had to worry about Evan's interaction with Marcus Chamberlain as it went better than she could ever imagine. But in this scene, the reader won't know this yet. So don't mention it.
Special Instructions/Notes:
I have provided all the dialogue needed for this scene. Please use my dialogue verbatim, adding no dialogue or removing any dialogue.

            <Title>0200 Evan Gives Sarah the Vintage Doll</Title>
            <Synopsis>An excited Evan meets Sarah near her car before the game. He gives her the vintage doll that she asked for.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A crisp, cool morning greeted central Illinois with a partly sunny sky, casting a gentle glow over the lush grassy regions and well-maintained softball fields. The freshness of early fall tingled in the air, mixing with the distant laughter of children and the muted thud of softballs hitting gloves. Leaves, touched with hints of amber, rustled softly as young love seemed to fill the atmosphere with a sweetness as vibrant as the season itself.
Evan stood in the parking lot, dressed in his softball uniform, spiked cleats tapping impatiently on the pavement. Though his glove was absent, his eyes were alight with anticipation, scanning the horizon for Sarah’s white Audi sedan.
Sarah, meanwhile, was an epitome of casual college charm, clad in an orange and blue University of Illinois sweatshirt, a cute knit hat, matching scarf, and five-finger mittens adorned in the same blue that represented her university. Her jeans were comfortably casual, her ankle-high black zippered boots everyday and affordable. 
Evan’s heart leaped as Sarah’s car pulled into the lot. She was just as excited as he, her eyes sparkling as they locked onto his. They rushed to each `other, their greeting sealed with a passionate kiss before a word was spoken.
“I’ve got something for you!” Evan exclaimed, his voice tinged with boyish excitement.
“You do?” Sarah’s eyes widened, the anticipation bubbling within her.
With a flourish, Evan grabbed the vintage doll from his car and handed it to Sarah. The typically stoic Sarah transformed, giddy like a schoolgirl. Tears welled in her eyes as she recalled the sentimental nature of the gift, feeling the weight of the pendant tucked under her sweatshirt.
“Are you ready to meet my friends?” Evan asked, snapping her back to the moment.
“I’m nervous but as ready as I’ll ever be,” Sarah admitted, her voice trembling slightly. “I even went shopping with Katie yesterday to look the part,” she added, gesturing to her outfit.
Evan enveloped her in a reassuring hug, comforting her with his warmth. As they pulled apart, Sarah opened her car door, grabbing a book.
“Evan, do you mind if I read a book during your game?” she asked, a playful glint in her eye.
“Of course, I don’t mind. Our games can last as long as two hours, and I fully support and understand that your academics are your number one priority,” Evan replied warmly. “I’m nothing but grateful that you’re coming to my games.”
Sarah couldn’t help but laugh, her eyes dancing with amusement. “That’s good to know; maybe I’ll need to bring some study materials one day. But this book is not about academics.” She smiled widely and showed Evan the front of the book. Softball for Dummies.
The revelation caused a hearty laugh from both of them, the humor enhancing the sweetness of the moment.
“I don’t know anything about sports. If I’m going to come to your games, I want to understand the rules as best as I can,” Sarah explained.
“You are so adorable!” Evan exclaimed, his eyes twinkling.
Sarah felt a surge of endorphins at the compliment. No one had ever called her adorable before.
“The game is about to start. Let’s go,” Evan urged, but he sensed Sarah’s nervousness in her eyes and body language.
She looked at him, a touch of vulnerability in her gaze. “Can I have a kiss?” she asked, her voice soft.
Evan obliged, their lips meeting in a tender and uplifting kiss.
As they headed toward the bleachers, where Evan would introduce Sarah to his inner circle of friends, the connection between them felt more profound, more secure. The moment was sealed, a memory etched into their hearts, and the promise of young love blossoming.</Text>

            <Title>0222 Patti Seeks Advice from Guido</Title>
            <Synopsis>Patti reluctantly reveals to Guido that their circle of friends has &quot;chosen&quot; her to persuade Evan that his relationship with Sarah is misguided. Though Patti harbors no great affection for Guido, she finds herself valuing his unfiltered honesty regarding Evan and Sarah's relationship, even if some of his opinions rankle her. Their conversation showcases a complex interplay of conflicting emotions, alliances, and a shared concern for Eva.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Patti plopped down on the sofa after Evan left for Sarah’s fundraising event, her mind swirling with thoughts and emotions. Guido, still in the midst of a rather unfruitful journey through his little black book, looked up, noticing the distress in her eyes.
“I know you’re not my biggest fan, but if you need someone to talk to, I’m here,” he said, his voice surprisingly tender.
She looked at him, uncertainty in her eyes. Could I really talk to Guido about this? she wondered. After a moment’s pause, she decided to take the chance.
“Several of our friends have asked me to persuade Evan that his relationship with Sarah is misguided,” she confessed, her voice trembling slightly.
Guido’s eyes widened. He realized this would be a more extended conversation than he had hoped. Heading to the fridge, he grabbed two beers, opened them, and handed one to Patti. He took a guzzle from his bottle and sat on the loveseat perpendicular to the sofa, sharing the same end table. “You look like you could use this.”
She nodded, taking the beer. “You have no idea.”
“I don’t know if I can do it,” she told him, her voice breaking. “I still have feelings for Evan but still value Evan’s friendship.”
Guido looked at her sympathetically, not at all surprised. He’d always known. “What do you think of Evan and Sarah’s relationship?” she asked him, seeking an honest opinion.
Guido leaned back, considering his response. “I don’t get Evan. In my opinion, Evan should enjoy his college years as I do.” He comments how Evan has it easy. “Girls flock to Evan while I have to work for my hot honeys. If I were Evan, I’d play the field – A different girl every other night of the week. But Evan is Evan.”
Patti frowned, not quite getting the answer she sought. “Do you think she’s right for him?” she asked again.
Guido’s eyes narrowed, and he looked at her intently. “You want me to sugarcoat it, or do you want the Guido to give it to you raw?”
“Neither, really. But I guess there’s no point in you holding back, so give it to me raw,” she replied, bracing herself for his words.
He didn’t hold back. “Not that I could ever think like Evan regarding women, but I thought you and him were doing it right. You’re both in college, having fun, but no strings attached. You are smoking hot. I would’ve kept hooking up with you through senior year if I were Evan.”
Patti’s cheeks flushed at his bluntness. “What do you think about Sarah?” she asked, steering the conversation back.
“What I say here never leaves this room. Do we have an understanding?”
“Yes, of course. I won’t tell anyone, even Roxanne.”
“I don’t get it. I don’t get it at all. They have very little in common. But maybe that’s the point?”
“What do you mean?” Patti asked.
“I marvel at how Evan attracts women when he knows so little about them. I might even say I’m green with envy. I can only imagine what it’s like to have girls lined up at my front door.”
Patti’s eyes widened, trying to follow his train of thought. “I don’t understand your point.”
He looked annoyed by her impatience. “That’s because you didn’t let me finish. If it’s that easy for him to get a girl, then maybe what attracts him to Sarah is that although he reeled her in pretty quickly, for the first time, he experienced a girl who made him work for it. See what I mean?”
Could Guido actually be right? Patti thought, considering his words. “You may be right. I never really thought about it that way.”
Guido’s face lit up, a triumphant smile spreading across his lips. His chest puffed out, and he leaned back, clearly pleased with himself. “Of course I’m right. The Guido is always right!” he proclaimed, relishing Patti’s rare validation.
“Now that she’s been ‘caught,’” Patti said, air quoting the word caught. “Do you think he’ll lose interest and back away?”
“I know you may not wanna hear this, but the only way that relationship ends is if Sarah ends it. Evan is convinced she’s ‘the one.’  His words, not mine. Regardless of what you and I think, it’s impossible to derail Evan when he commits to something.”
“Why can’t he see what we all see? Sooner or later, that relationship is going to stop working. He needs to get out now before things get too serious.”
Guido shook his head, a look of amused frustration in his eyes. “Oh Patti, Patti, Patti, you’re not getting it. Evan is in love with Sarah, or at least he thinks he is. He won’t admit it, and nobody seems to understand this, but Evan is the epitome of a hopeless romantic. He is blinded by love. I doubt anything we say will open his eyes to reality.”
Patti’s heart ached at his words. Could she really do this? Could she really warn Evan off of Sarah? “I’m not sure what to do. As a friend, I think I should share what we all feel and warn him off Sarah. But I’m not sure if I trust my motivation. I don’t want to come off as a jealous ex.”
Guido’s eyes softened. “I decided to let Evan make his own mistakes. And be there for him when he inevitably crashes and burns.”
“Is that what you think I should do? Just back away and let him crash and burn? Hoping that when he sees Sarah’s not right for him, he may understand that there are better options for him, even if it’s not me.
“You gonna do what you’re gonna do no matter what I say. I know there’s nothing I can say to stop you from warning Evan off of Sarah. I can see it in your eyes.”
“I don’t want to, Guido. But Roxanne made it clear that if I don’t do it, she will. That would be a disaster on all levels.”
He nodded, understanding her dilemma. “I get it. Who knows, maybe something you say will click in Evan’s head down the road. But for now, understand that your words will fall on deaf ears. And then you’re left with a tough choice.”
“Choice?”
“Either tell Evan how you feel about him and press the issue with Sarah or do what I think you should do and be his friend and be happy for him if it works out and be there to catch him if he falls.”
Patti’s eyebrows shot up, her surprise evident. “That’s pretty sound advice coming from you.”
Guido leaned forward, his voice dripping with self-assured bravado. “Everyone always underestimates the Guido.” He punctuated the statement with a wink, his grin widening as if he were sharing a secret joke with the world. 
“I don’t know if I can stand around waiting and watching him with Sarah.”
“Then don’t. Get yourself back out there. Hop back on that horse. Find yourself a dude to keep your bed warm at night. You still got almost two full years of college. Live it up!”
Patti laughed, “Now that’s the kind of advice I expected from you, Guido.”
Guido’s eyes danced with mischief, leaning back comfortably. “I’m not gonna lie. I’d be happy to fill that need for your right now. But no can do.”
Patti laughed loudly, throwing her head back. “I can’t wait to hear this. Why ‘no can do’?”
Guido grinned, his eyes twinkling with mischief, never losing his casual demeanor. “I’m not gonna lie. I’d be happy to fill that need for you right now. But once a girl does Evan, she’s off-limits to the Guido. I don’t do my friends like that.”
Patti’s face turned bright red at his comment. “I’m not sure if I should be insulted or flattered.”
“Flattered, of course.”
“Of course.” She rolled her eyes, but there was a smile on her face. 
Guido leaned back, sighing exaggeratedly, his hands spread in a dramatic gesture of defeat. “I gotta tell you, though, Patti. It ain’t easy. You’re the hottest piece of ass Evan’s ever hooked up with.” He paused, noticing a flicker in her eyes, a silent question that lingered in the air between them. “And yes, even hotter than Sarah,” Guido said with a wink.
Patti laughed again, her hand covering her mouth, her eyes wide with disbelief but unsure what to say. Guido’s shamelessness was both appalling and oddly endearing.
Before she could respond, Guido’s phone rang. It was a black book favorite returning his call. “I gotta go, Patti. I have a live one on the hook.”
He headed to his bedroom, leaving Patti to her thoughts.
Patti was left alone in the room, her emotions still in turmoil. She took one last look at the space where Evan had stood, feeling both grateful for Guido’s words and more confused than ever.</Text>
            <Notes>Either in this scene or in a later scene with Patti and Evan, &quot;girlfriends and boyfriends come and go but friends can last forever.&quot;
The compassionate Guido says I know what you're asking yourself, &quot;what does she have that I don't have.&quot; Guido says there is nothing that she has that you don't have, your top-notch.
Just what Patti is beginning to see the compassionate side of Guido, boom he gets a call from his black book back to the old Guido.</Notes>

Title: Patti Learns Evan Has a New Girlfriend
Summary: From the bleachers, Patti, Evan's recent quasi-ex-girlfriend, observes Evan and Sarah meeting in the parking lot. Guido and Roxane, Sarah's best friend, share with Patti what they know and have heard about Sarah, adding context to the budding relationship.
Setting:
Location: The aluminum bleachers at a softball field in a large recreational park in central Illinois.
Time: 11:00 AM
Weather/Environment: Partly sunny. A cool crisp early fall morning.
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Patti)
Dialogue Focus: Moderate
Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Patti, Roxanne, Guido, 
Secondary Characters: Sarah, Evan
Character Emotional State:
Patti: On the inside, Pattie hurt, stung, jealous, conflicted. On the outside she is calm, serene, but curious about Sarah and Evan's feelings for Sarah.
Roxanne: Angry at Evan for choosing Sarah over Patti. 
Guido: Angry at Evan for choosing Sarah over Patti. 
Plot/Action:
Beginning: The scene starts with Patti observing Evan and Sarah in the parking lot as he is giving her the doll, and they are being affectionate, giggling, and having a good time. Every time Evan kisses Sarah, it feels like a punch in the gut to Patti. We want the reader to experience, through deeper POV and internal dialogue, how Patti is feeling as she is watching Evan with a new woman.
Middle: 
Roxanne sees Patti watching Evan and Sarah and makes derogatory comments about Sarah.
Guido is warming up, playing catch nearby. Roxanne calls them over to get the scoop on Sarah.
Guido informs them he hasn't even met her yet. He has little to tell them except that Evan seems crazy about this chick.
Roxanne was surprised that Patti didn't see Evan's relationship status change on Facebook.
Adding shock to Patti's system is that she had no idea Evan has a new girlfriend or that she would be attending the game.
End: 
Evan introduces Sarah to his group of friends watching from the bleachers and Guido. 
Conflicted between wanting to support Evan and welcome his girlfriend into their inner circle and feeling like a jilted ex-girlfriend, Patti forces a silent smile after the introduction. 
Immediately after the introduction, the team’s coach calls Evan and Guido in for the start of the game. 
This is where the scene ends.
Objectives/Goals:
The primary objective of the scene is to help readers understand Evan's romantic relationships before Sarah. Please review Patti and Evan's profiles to understand Evan's exclusive and monogamous but casual college relationships before Sarah.
Through Patti's eyes, we see that Sarah differs from his past relationships. And at this point in the story, no one can be sure if the relationship will last and why Evan would choose Sarah over Patti. Patti is every bit as beautiful as Sarah and far more compatible.
It is crucial to understand Patti's conflict in this scene. In the previous school year, Patti was well aware of Evan's unusual monogamous but casual relationship history. He never deceived her or called her his girlfriend. They were good friends before they started sleeping together. However, somewhere along the line, Patti developed strong feelings for Evan and began to feel like a girlfriend. She lasted twice as long as any other girl Evan was with, and Evan even introduced Patti to his sister – something he had never done before. However, when the school year ended, and Patti went back home for summer break, the intimate aspect of the relationship ended. When the current school year started, Evan treated her as a good friend, as though the intimate part of the relationship had never happened. She thought he would come around and be with her again, and the next thing you know, he has a girlfriend.
Props/Items:
Bleachers
Dialogue:
Key Lines:
Roxanne: &quot;I heard she's a stuck-up snob – a rich bitch.&quot;
Guido: &quot;I don't know nothing about this chick, except that Evan is nuts about her and calls her his girlfriend. That's the first time I ever heard him call someone's girlfriend. It all happened so fast. I haven't even met her yet.&quot;
Patti (internal dialogue): &quot;Girlfriend? He never even called me his girlfriend.&quot;
Roxanne: &quot;Look at her, trying to look like one of us. She'll never be one of us. Look, she even bought a fucking book to read.&quot;
Roxanne: &quot;I don't know what he sees in her.“
Patti: &quot;She's very beautiful.&quot;
Roxanne: &quot;She doesn't hold a candle to you. You’re twice as beautiful as her. Right, Guido?
Guido: &quot;I think they're both smoking hot! But you know that kind of stuff doesn't matter, Evan. He's all about &quot;chemistry.&quot;
Roxanne: ”He should be with you, Patti. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it. Right, Guido?&quot;
Guido: &quot;I ain't saying nothing. I want no part of all your drama stuff.&quot;
Patti: &quot;Shush! Here they come.&quot;
Sarah: &quot;It's nice to meet you all.&quot;
Tone: Curious, Somber, Wounded, Reflective
Action Tags/Dialogue Tags:
When introducing Sarah, aware of her nervousness, Evan stands back with Sarah several feet and quickly introduces Patti, Roxanne, Guido, and a few other friends who play no vital role in the story. The reason he stands back is so that no one feels an obligation to handshake or hug. The game starts immediately after the introduction. Guido and Evan head for the field.
Guido says, Evan. He's all about &quot;chemistry.&quot; In a mocking tone. Because Guido is not a romantic and puts no value on the concept of romantic chemistry.
Patti is reflective and serene during this scene, even though inside, she is hurting.
During this scene, Roxanne is animated in both face and body/arm motions. She's angry at Evan and has negatively prejudged Sarah.
Themes/Motifs:
Betrayal hurt feelings
Notes:
Not much has to be said about the setting in this scene. However, at the beginning of the scene, mentioned that Patti is sitting on cold aluminum bleachers. Creatively tie in the bleachers’ “coldness” to how Patti feels seeing Evan with another woman.
Summary/Synopsis:
From the bleachers, Patti, Evan's most recent quasi-ex-girlfriend, watches Evan and Sarah meet in the parking lot. Guido and Sarah's best friend, Roxane, tell Patti what they know and what they've heard about Sarah.

Title: Evan Slows his Roll
Summary:
A steamy make-out session commences after an effective tutoring session and a delicious dinner. Amid the rising heat intensifying kisses and wandering hands, Evan stops himself midstream. He wants to wait until the moment feels right and Sarah is ready before they take their intimacy to the next level. 
Setting:
Location: Sarah's apartment
Time: Friday evening
Weather/Environment: Severe thunderstorm.
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Sarah, Evan
Secondary Characters: Information
Character Emotional State:
Evan: Hopeful, anticipatory, passionate
Sarah: Happy, Relaxed and comfortable, passionate
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)
Dialogue Focus: Moderate
Use of Internal Dialogue: Heavy
Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
Sarah orders the pizza.
She grabbed Evan’s hand and took him on a tour of her apartment.
Evan notices some freshman textbooks in the guest room and asks Sarah bought them.
She tells Evan that her friend Katie uses her guestroom as a study sanctuary.
When Sarah shows Evan her bedroom, he flirts, telling Sarah it’s already his favorite room.
She smiles with mischief in her eyes and says, “I bet it is.” Then she grabs his hand and finishes the rest of the tour, kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room, before looking out the floor-to-ceiling glass windows and marveling at the lightning show appearing in the skies above.
Middle: 
Evan tells Sarah that he loves to watch movies on a stormy night.
She responds that it sounds like a wonderful idea.
Evan asks Sarah what kind of movies she likes, and she surprises him by telling him she rarely watches movies or TV.
She expresses surprise when Evan's excited about that.
He says something like. “That's awesome! I get to share all my favorite movies with you. It'll be fun watching my favorite movies with someone who hasn't seen them yet.”
Evan grabs Sarah's hand and enthusiastically pulls her to the sofa, sitting down with her and grabbing the remote. After downloading his streaming movie app and logging onto his account, he scrolls to the movies looking for a movie he thinks she would like.
Before the movie starts, Sarah says she'll be right back. 
She returned moments later with a blanket for them to cuddle under.
Evan is excited for her to see one of his favorite movies for the first time, and they cuddle watching the movie.
Half an hour in, the pizza arrives. Evan gets up, but Sarah tells him to stay seated– she's got this. She grabs the pizza, tips the soaking-wet pizza delivery man a few extra bucks, and places the pizza on the kitchen counter.
She asks Evan how many pieces he wants. He says two. She grabs a plate and puts two slices of pizza on his plate, one on hers, and places the plates on the coffee table in front of the sofa.
She grabbed herself another glass of wine and Evan another beer and rejoined him on the sofa.
Since this is Sarah’s first time eating pizza in recent memory, provide a deeper POV as she experiences the pizza and enjoys it far more than she thought she would.
She compliments Evan on his choice of pizzerias. After some chitchat, they settle back in and continue watching the movie while finishing most of the pizza.
When they Are finished eating, Sarah asks Evan to pause the movie. She quickly rinses the dishes, places them in the dishwasher, closes the pizza box, and puts leftovers in the fridge.
She then heads to the bathroom to brush her teeth, anticipating more kissing before the evening ends.
Having the same thought, Evan tossed breath mints in his mouth and promptly chewed and chomped them to finish them off before Sarah returned. He wanted fresh breath as much as Sarah did for the inevitable kissing ahead.
When she returned, they cuddled under the blanket, the thunder getting louder and louder, at one point rattling the windows and causing Sarah to jump out of her seat and her heart to beat fast.
Between cracks of thunder, Sarah recognized how wonderful it felt just watching a movie cuddling with her man. The thought made her giggle out loud.
Evan asked what the giggling was about. She told him how good she felt cuddling with him. She told him she never understood when she overheard girls talking about cuddling, kissing, and holding hands like it was the greatest thing in the world. She looks up at Evan and says, now I get it. I really get it. I love the way I'm feeling.
End: 
A huge, loud clap of thunder rattled the whole house, including Evan and Sarah, causing the power to go out.
Both their hearts beating from the shock of the thunder clapping, they giggle and use their phones as flashlights as they navigate to the drawer where Sarah keeps her candles.
She lit the candles, and they returned to the couch. With the power being out and nothing to watch on TV, they spend the next half hour enjoying conversation, talking about this and that. During that time, the storm passes over, and the thunder moves into the distance, but the power is still out.
Evan gets a romantic look in his eyes. The studying session, the storm, cuddling, and everything about that night increased his affection for Sarah.
He looked into her eyes, and they started kissing slowly and sensually. The kissing became increasingly more passionate, and Sarah felt Evan's hands wander over the outside of her clothing while they were kissing. She was getting very turned on and felt uncertain how far she was willing to go with Evan. She didn't know if she had the strength or desire to say no to Evan.
Her decision was made moot when Evan abruptly stopped, stood up, and walked to the kitchen, splashing water on his face.
She followed him and asked him if he was okay. She thought maybe she was a bad kisser or did something wrong.
More serious than she had seen him to that point, Evan looked deeply into her eyes and told her he wanted to do this right– even if it meant waiting to make love to her. He doesn't want to rush into the intimacy. 
Sarah agrees she wants them to take that next step when the time is right. She asks Evan how they will know. 
Evan doesn't have much of an answer except to say I suppose we will know when we know.
The lights pop back on, and the TV volume fills the room.
Evan tells Sarah that he must go. He really wants to be with her and doesn't trust himself right now. His passion and desire are strong.
She understands and walks him to the door, where they share a slow sensual kiss goodbye.
Objectives/Goals:
This scene is meant to show how Sarah is different than other girls he's been with. Even though Sarah seemed willing to make love with Evan, it was Evan who backed off. He wants this relationship to be perfect in every way, even if it means waiting for something he could have right now.
Props/Items:
Pizza 
TV and TV remote
Dishwasher
Plates
Refrigerator
Beer and Wine
Katie's freshman textbooks
Evan's breath mints
Tone: Happy, Anticipatory, startled from cracks of thunder, passion, and romance
Special Instructions/Notes:
I don't have much prewritten dialogue in this scene. You have complete discretion to write a compelling scene using as much rich narrative, spoken and internal dialogue as needed.
I want this scene to be a sensory and emotional experience for the reader. As Evan and Sarah start the scene happy and hopeful, enjoying the simplicity of the night at home cuddling on the couch watching the movie, to being startled by the crack of thunder, and then experiencing the throes of passion only to abruptly stop so that when the time is right their lovemaking can be savored and not rushed prematurely. 
And then finally ending the scene with a sensual romantic kiss.
Let's make every effort to engage the reader in all these emotions.
</Text>
            <Notes>Evan and Sarah's lips met hesitantly at first, a gentle brush that was tentative and exploratory. As their mouths opened, their kisses deepened, each one more profound than the last, allowing the slow burn of passion to build. Their hands found each other, fingers entwining, while their bodies pressed closer. Time seemed to stretch and twist as the kisses grew more intense and hungry. The world around them faded, leaving only the growing desire that swirled and crackled between them, binding them in a moment that felt both infinite and all too brief. The hesitant start had blossomed into a storm of emotion, a connection that spoke of promises and a future yet to be explored.

Of secondary importance, she would like to be married and have a child to raise like she was raised. However, she would only want a child if it didn’t interfere with her professional aspirations.
Education background: 
She graduated as valedictorian from Ballard  High School in Seattle.
She is in his senior year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Working on earning a Bachelor's Degree in Business. 
Family/general background: 
Sarah Wilkins, an only child, was a beacon of exceptionalism, born and bred for success. Raised in a household where playdates and frivolous activities were forsaken for the grandeur of academia, Sarah found herself immersed in an ocean of knowledge from an early age. Her childhood revolved around devouring non-fiction educational books, her imagination flickering not with tales of adventure but with the enlightening prose of fact and theory.
Her parents, particularly her domineering father, were the rudder that steered the ship of her life. The University of Illinois, her father's alma mater, became Sarah's undergraduate choice despite being capable of securing a scholarship to any institution across the country. Even with the allure of prestigious Ivy League schools for her postgraduate studies, the sense of legacy and deference to her father's wishes guided her decision.
Sarah's relationship with her father was less traditional and more of a mentorship, a catalyst that stimulated her thirst for learning. Their household, punctuated by an omnipresent stoicism, eschewed affection for mutual respect. Hugs were a rarity, with personal growth and intellectual achievement held on a higher pedestal.
Sarah was a paragon of her parents' molding, embracing the rigorous standards they set for her. Her extraordinarily high IQ melded seamlessly with their crafted path, creating an academic prodigy poised for greatness. Valedictorian of her high school, she graduated college with the same top honors, her formidable pre-college resume testament to her commitment and prowess.
In the whirlwind of academia, Sarah found herself baffled by the incessant chatter of girls concerning boys. While she wasn't entirely immune to the fluttering feelings of attraction, dating was more of an anthropological study for her. She wanted to decipher the energy and time girls dedicated to boys, a concept alien to her own mindset.
As she transitioned to college, Sarah made a pact with herself: no dalliances, no romantic distractions. Her goal was singular - acquire her master's degree, lay the foundation of a successful professional life. It was a pledge set in stone, the echo of her parents' teachings resonating within her, guiding her towards the brilliance they had prepared her for.
Relationship status/history: 
In high school, Sarah experimented briefly with boys. She wasn't a virgin when she started college but had minimal experience compared to other females her age.
Before meeting Evan, she honored her commitment to avoid all romantic entanglements in college.
Health history: 
Sarah was meticulous regarding self-care. Her dietary habits would impress the strictest of nutritionists. She was religious in her exercise routine, combining time indoors at the gym and jogging and biking outdoors.
Interestingly, Sarah's motivation to keep healthy and fit had little to do with vanity or lifespan. Instead, she always wants to look presentable and confident in business meetings, negotiations, and social events from philanthropic endeavors and business ventures.
How does the character handle stress or crisis situations?  
Sarah is as stoic as they come. She is calm under pressure. Her high IQ and business brilliance often lead to quickly resolving any crisis.
What motivates this character? 
Even before Sarah began her high school journey, her path forward was as clear as a sunlit highway. She would be the valedictorian of her graduating class – this wasn't a possibility; it was an expectation. Such was the certainty of her brilliance and the weight of the destiny she felt she had been handed down.
The University of Illinois was the stepping stone, a nod to her father's legacy. Once there, she intended to dominate the academic charts, rising as cream does to the top. Her sights, though, were firmly set on the gleaming towers of the Ivy League for her master's degree, an ambition as naturally conceived as a sunflower turning towards the sun.
College was not just about academics for Sarah. It was an opportunity to broaden her connections and foster relationships within circles of influence and wealth. Her philanthropic endeavors, while rooted in a sincere desire to make a difference, also served the dual purpose of positioning her within networks of power. Every charity event attended, every fundraiser led, they were stepping stones on the path to fulfilling her destiny.
Primary Goal: Sarah's ultimate goal was to replace her father as CEO of his multi-million dollar corporation.
Key Conflict: 
Sarah's heart was entangled in a fierce battle between her love for Evan and her father's carefully crafted life plan for her. On one hand, there was Evan, the man who had ignited her soul and shown her a world of love and emotional depth she had never known. He challenged her to embrace vulnerability and live for the moment, beckoning her to break free from the rigid confines of her predestined path.
On the other hand, there was her father, the respected figure whose expectations had guided her every step. The thought of disappointing him weighed heavily on her, as she had always strived to be the embodiment of his ambitions and aspirations. But as she stood at this critical crossroad, Sarah knew that whichever choice she made, an important man in her life would be left disheartened. The weight of the decision pressed upon her like a relentless storm, and she yearned for a way to reconcile her heart's desires with the legacy she was meant to fulfill.
What is the character's role in the novel? 
Sarah's role is the protagonist and female love interest. The story revolves around her unexpected romance with Evan. We see throughout the story that she fights her feelings for Evan along the way. But his charm and persistence shatters her resistance. Ultimately, she chooses her love for Evan over her promise to  her father. After the elopement, she wonder if she made the best choice.
What are some of the character’s key life events: 
Her decision to break a rule about dating in college.

I am currently working on Sarah's profile. I wanted to include a narrative description. Please write a description of Sarah given the following bullet points.
Sarah was an only child.
Her birth/maiden name is Sarah Wilkins.
From birth, her parents raised her for success.
There were no play dates or dance classes for Sarah. Instead, her parents focused on academics. As a child, Sarah devoted extracurricular time to expanding her knowledge base, primarily by reading non-fiction educational books.
Sarah was the valedictorian of her high school and graduated top of her class in college.
Her focus in high school was academics. Her pre-college resume was formidable. She could get a full scholarship at any university in the country. She planned to attend a prestigious Ivy League university for her master's degree. However, she attended the University of Illinois for undergrad work because that was her father's alma mater.
Sarah's father played a dominant role in his marriage. His wife was submissive and dutiful.
Sarah respected her father.
Sarah's relationship with her father was more mentor/mentee than father/daughter.
The Wilkins household was stoic. The three household members respected each other, but affection was minimal. There weren't many hugs in Sarah's childhood.
Sarah embraced the way that she was raised. She had an extraordinarily high IQ, and her parent's method of reading her for success made a lot of sense.
In high school, Sarah could never understand why girls spent so much time talking about boys. However, she did find herself occasionally being attracted to a boy.
She did date a few times in high school but did it more to find out why girls spend so much energy on boys than it was because she was interested in them.
When it was time for college, Sarah promised herself she would not get caught up in the social trappings that college life can bring. She decided to avoid all romantic relationships until she achieved her master's degree and was ready to start her professional life.

I am working on explaining Sarah's motivation. Please write a narrative based on the following bullet points:
Sarah's future was written in stone before she started high school.
She expected to graduate valedictorian of her high school class.
She expected to be top of her class at the University of Illinois and whatever Ivy League school she decided to attend for her master's degree.
She was to spend her free time on philanthropic endeavors during her college years. In part to give back to the community. But also to build contacts and relationships with other wealthy men and women in the business world.
After she obtained her master's degree, she would take a position at her father's corporation. She wouldn't be starting at an entry-level, but also wouldn't start in upper management. Her father wanted her to climb the corporate ladder through effort, diligence, and skill – not nepotism.
Sarah was particularly interested in expanding her father's corporate dealings overseas. Her father's company had a minimal presence outside the United States. She was looking to make a name for herself through successful expansion internationally.
Ultimately, her final goal was to replace her father as the CEO of his multimillion-dollar corporation when he retired.
As far as her personal life, she had decided to one day marry a successful man similar to her father. However, while she respected her mother, Sarah did not want to play the role of a supportive wife. She wanted to play the role of an equal partner in a marriage. She wanted one and only one child that she would raise in the way that she was raised.

Please provide a narrative to explain why Sarah asked for a divorce with Evan giving the following bullet points:
Sarah loved Evan very much.
He was the only one who could tap into that more feminine, affectionate part of her that was inaccessible and invisible to everyone else.
Sarah felt uncomfortable with the emotional aspects that Evan exposed. She didn't like feeling controlled by her emotions. She felt critical of other women who seemed imprisoned by their feelings and didn't want that.
She regretted not following her lifelong goals. Even though she was successful in her own right with Evan, she craved returning to her plan and working at her father's corporation.
She knew that Evan loved her and would follow her anywhere she went. But in her heart of hearts, she realized they would never be in sync. Additionally, she couldn't move him so from his sister, Liz. Evan Liz had such a special bond. 
Seattle was so far from Chicago, and Sarah worried that would negatively impact Evan and Liz's brother-sister connection.
She walked out on Evan without attempting to negotiate with him as she always had in past differences because she knew he would connect with her deeper emotional self like he did when he asked her to marry him. She knew Evan, well-meaning as he would have been, would have caused her to make a decision she would later regret. 
She was committed to achieving her lifelong goal; even her love for Evan would not stand in the way. To her credit, she considered this the best decision for Evan, even if he couldn't see it at the time.

What role does this setting play in the story?
Guido and Evan take charge of this grand space, leasing it for a night to host an exuberant post-graduation party. The Champaign Hotel Grand Ballroom transforms from a simple gathering spot into an integral setting for a pivotal moment in the story.
It's within the enchanting walls of this ballroom that Evan musters the courage to propose to Sarah. Amidst the celebration and festive sounds, the room falls silent for a brief, magical moment as Evan expresses his love and commitment to Sarah.
Adding an unexpected twist to the evening, Sarah is taken aback when she spots her parents amidst the crowd, their presence a surprise to her. This eventful night also presents the sole opportunity for Evan to meet Sarah's parents. The interactions and emotions unfolding within the grandeur of this ballroom deepen the narrative, as relationships are explored, and bonds are solidified.
Description:
Tucked within the sophisticated Champaign Hotel, the Grand Ballroom offers a spacious and stylish venue for lively college parties. It blends traditional elegance with contemporary design elements, exuding a vibrant and welcoming ambiance, perfect for a memorable evening.
Upon entering the room, the sight of a small, but professionally-equipped stage draws immediate attention. It's an intimate platform set against a textured backdrop, spotlighted by a couple of sleek stage lights hanging from the ceiling. This area serves as the announcement center, creating a focal point in the room and drawing the crowd together for key moments.
The dance floor, a significant feature of the ballroom, stretches out invitingly in front of the stage. Its polished wooden surface, reflecting the soft, colorful glow of strategically placed LED lights, tempts even the most reserved attendees to let loose and dance. Positioned to encourage interaction and fun, the dance floor becomes the heart of the party, pulsating with energy and laughter.
The ballroom's high ceiling enhances the sense of space, accommodating the 30-40 party-goers comfortably. A series of chic, crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling, casting a soft, inviting light throughout the room. Ambient wall sconces complement the chandeliers, ensuring the room is well-lit yet retains an intimate feel.
Round tables draped in crisp, white linens and adorned with minimalistic centerpieces are strategically arranged around the dance floor. Each seats four to six guests, promoting comfortable conversation and interaction among the party-goers. 
On one side of the room, a long, buffet-style table offers a selection of refreshments and finger foods, ideal for refueling during the festivities. On the opposite side, a well-stocked bar serves a variety of drinks, tended by a friendly, skilled bartender. 
Despite its formal setting, the Grand Ballroom exudes a youthful charm, making it a fitting location for a gathering of exuberant college students. The setting, while sophisticated, is infused with an infectious energy that inspires camaraderie, fun, and perhaps a touch of romance among its young guests.

            <Title>0120 Waiting Game</Title>
            <Text>Evan stood under the dreary clouds, a gray blanket unfurling across the morning sky. The location, the same place where he and Sarah first kissed, filled him with a sense of hopeful anticipation. It was Friday, the day after the unforgettable kiss, and he found himself drawn back, a hopeful pilgrim to a shrine of his own making.
He oscillated between hope and disappointment like a pendulum, his heart racing every time a blonde head appeared in his peripheral vision or the doors to the undergrad library swung open. Yet, each time, it wasn't her. The figure would solidify into a stranger, and the library doors would admit someone else, causing his heart to drop in his chest. 
As the minutes turned into hours, the weather started to mirror his gloom. The rain began, a soft drizzle that escalated steadily, soaking through his jacket. He darted between trees and awnings, attempting to stay dry, but he wouldn't stray far from his post. His need for a direct view of the library doors and the place of their first kiss kept him exposed to the elements. The rain, initially a light mist, grew heavier, each drop echoing his mounting despair.
Two hours into his vigil, the figure of Guido appeared. His friend stood next to him, huddled in his own jacket, his eyebrows raised in inquiry. &quot;No luck?&quot;
Evan lowered his gaze, his voice barely audible against the patter of the rain. &quot;No, I haven't seen her.&quot;
Guido clapped a hand on his shoulder, his gruff voice breaking through Evan's reverie. &quot;Sorry, bro. Don't stress it. There are plenty of fish in the sea.&quot;
Evan shook his head. &quot;I don't want to fish in the sea. She's the only one for me.&quot;
&quot;You ever consider, bro, that maybe she didn't show up because she has a boyfriend?&quot; Guido turned to Evan, a pragmatic expression etched on his face..
&quot;I just can't see it, Guido.&quot; Evan shook his head, his expression thoughtful.
&quot;You've said she's a stunner, right?&quot; Guido arched a questioning eyebrow.
Evan's eyes softened, his voice quiet. &quot;She transcends stunning. Her face... it's angelic.&quot;
&quot;Then isn't it possible some other dude's claimed that angel for himself?&quot; Guido pointed out, punctuating his words with a slight shrug.
&quot;I can't believe she would've kissed me if so. But there's something more...&quot; Evan's gaze drifted off, lost in memory. &quot;The way she looked at me, something in her eyes, it felt like... like she was meant to be mine.&quot;
Guido, bemused by Evan's impassioned response, ribbed him further. &quot;Man, what's so spectacular about this girl? She packin' triple D's or something?&quot;
Evan halted, throwing Guido a pointed look. His tone sharpened, &quot;Guido, knock it off. She's not just some random girl. She's exceptional. Show some respect, dude!&quot;
Guido raised his hands defensively, a grin still pulling at his lips. &quot;Alright, alright,&quot; he said, chuckling slightly. &quot;Didn't mean to ruffle your feathers. My bad.&quot; He stepped back slightly, folding his arms across his chest, his fingers tapping a playful beat against his biceps. &quot;I don't get you, dude. You got women lined up to be with you, and you're stressing over a girl whose name you don't know? You should adopt my style – no strings attached, no drama.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, and no hope for love,&quot; Evan retorted, his voice heavy.
Guido chuckled again, but his tone was softer, almost affectionate. &quot;My friend, ever the hopeless romantic.&quot;
Evan sighed, frustration creeping into his voice. &quot;I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm just... I'm just...just…&quot; He trailed off, unable to find the words. After a moment, he added, &quot;I don't know what I am. I just know that I have to see my Cinderella again.&quot;
Guido patted his back again, a grin spreading across his face. &quot;Let's leave the matching glass slipper search for another day. Come on, let's head back to our place. We’ll knock down a few beers and watch baseball. The Cubs actually have a chance for the playoffs this year!&quot;
Guido's words seemed to echo in the void around Evan, but they didn't seem to stir him from his spot.
Guido persisted, &quot;You'll feel a lot better with a cold brew in your hand and a Cubs victory on the TV. I’ll tell you what, after the game, we’ll try to figure a way to get her name.&quot;
Still, Evan remained silent, a statue against the rain and gloom.
Guido's joking tone made a comeback, &quot;How hard can it be to find the most beautiful girl on campus?&quot;
That finally managed to pull a small smile from Evan. &quot;I suppose you're right. I'll bump into her sooner or later.&quot;
Guido nodded, giving Evan's shoulder one last squeeze. &quot;Exactly! Let's chill at home, and we’ll scour the Internet when the game is over.&quot;
Guido started back towards their home, his voice trailing behind him, still filled with humor and lightness. Evan followed, but his steps were slow, reluctant. As the rain continued to fall, mingling with the sadness in his eyes, he cast one last lingering glance at the library doors. The weight of disappointment hung heavy in his chest, a dull ache that seemed to echo the emptiness of the deserted path where he had once found love, however fleeting.</Text>

            <Notes>Certainly! If Evan doesn't want to come across as too harsh, he could respond more lightly, but still assert his point, such as:

Guido: &quot;Not to be a downer, bro, but have you considered that maybe she didn't show because she's seeing someone?&quot;
Evan: &quot;Not a chance, Guido.&quot;
Guido: &quot;Well, you keep saying she's a knock-out, right?&quot; 
Evan: &quot;Beyond a knock-out. She's ethereal.&quot;
Guido: &quot;Then what makes you think some other guy hasn't already claimed that ethereal beauty?&quot;
Evan: &quot;She wouldn't have kissed me if she was with someone else. And it's not just that. The way she looked at me, there was something in her eyes that told me she was interested in me, and only me.&quot;
Guido found himself surprised by the intensity of Evan's emotions. &quot;Man, what's so special about this girl? She's got some secret charm or something?&quot;
Evan halted, his gaze hardening as he looked at Guido, a sternness to his voice. &quot;Enough, Guido. She's not just 'this girl'. She's different, she's unique. Let's maintain some respect here, alright?&quot;

Guido: &quot;I hate to bring this up, but maybe she didn't show because she has a boyfriend.&quot;
Evan: &quot;No way dude.&quot;
Guido: &quot;You said she's beautiful, didn't you?&quot; 
Evan: &quot;She's been on beautiful. She has the face of an angel.&quot;
Guido: &quot;the why don't you think some dude snagged that Angel?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't think she would kissed me. But it's more than that. Something in her eyes, the way she looked at me said she was mine.&quot;
Guido had never witnessed Evan respond to a woman with such intensity. &quot;Dude, what's so great about this chick? She got three boobs or something?&quot;
Evan paused, glancing at Guido, a slight edge to his voice. &quot;Guido, that's enough, man. She's not just some girl. She's special. Let's keep it classy, okay?&quot;

Title: Patti Confronts Evan about Sarah
Summary:

Their frustration grew when Evan chose to skip the next day's softball game, furthering their discontent with Sarah's influence on him. A few of Evan's friends reached a breaking point and gave Patti an ultimatum: either she warned Evan about Sarah, or Roxanne would do so. Feeling cornered, Patti felt she had to comply.

The sun was setting on the Saturday that Evan and his friends volunteered to clean up the farmlands of central Illinois after tornado.

            <Title>0220 Patti Helps Evan Get Ready</Title>
            <Synopsis>While grappling with her lingering feelings for Evan, Patti resolves to put her emotions aside to support him as a friend. With a determined effort to suppress her inner turmoil, she assists Evan in preparing for his first formalwear fundraising event with Sarah, demonstrating her commitment to their friendship. Her unspoken pining adds a layer of complexity to the scene, even as she focuses on helping Evan make the evening with Sarah special.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Patti sat on the worn-out couch in Evan's living room, casually observing Guido as he paced back and forth between his room and the kitchen. His voice carried through the apartment, the notes of desperation barely hidden as he called every woman in his little black book, hoping for a night of fun. The mismatched furniture and the cluttered shelves filled with textbooks and memorabilia hinted at the lives of two college-aged bachelors.
How can two such different people be best friends? Patti wondered, her eyes tracing Guido's erratic path. Evan was sincere and genuine, while Guido was... well, Guido. She'd asked Evan once, and he'd just smiled, brushing the question off with a comment about shared history. But as she watched Guido, the incomprehensibility of their friendship gnawed at her again.
Ironically, Patti's thoughts mirrored the very dynamic of her own relationship with her roommate and best friend Roxanne, who was her opposite in nearly every way.
Patti's thoughts were interrupted by a sudden exclamation from Evan's room. &quot;Patti! Can you come here a minute?&quot; he called out, his voice tinged with frustration.
Guido shot her a knowing grin as she rose from the couch, leaving him to his desperate dialing. &quot;Good luck with that,&quot; he teased, his eyes twinkling with mischief.
&quot;What's the matter?&quot; Patti asked, stepping into Evan's bedroom, a room that held both fond and conflicted memories for her.
Evan's face was flushed, and his brows were furrowed in concentration as he wrestled with his tie. &quot;I can't get this thing right, and I don't want to be late,&quot; he admitted, a hint of embarrassment in his eyes. His nervousness about the night ahead was palpable, yet to him, this moment with Patti was just another friendly interaction, not laden with the weight it held for her.
Her heart ached as she approached him, a forced smile on her face. &quot;Here, let me help you.&quot; Her hands took over the task, expertly tying the knot as her mind wandered back to their blurred-line friendship and the complex emotions it now stirred within her.
Evan stared at his reflection in frustration. The tie simply refused to cooperate. His fingers fumbled as he tried to twist it into place again, but it kept coming out wrong. The evening with Sarah loomed large, a night filled with promise, and he couldn't even get dressed properly.
A soft knock at the door brought a welcome distraction. &quot;Come in!&quot; he called out, still wrestling with the tie.
Patti entered, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. Evan's struggle was evident, and she came forward, ready to help.
&quot;Need some help there?&quot; she asked, her voice cheerful but a touch strained.
Evan laughed, releasing the tie and stepping back. &quot;I can't seem to get this right. I feel like a teenager on prom night.&quot;
Patti reached out, her fingers deftly taking over the task. You're not a teenager, and this isn't prom night. This is so much more, she thought, her heart aching with unspoken words.
Her hands worked on the tie, but her mind was elsewhere. In this very bedroom, they'd been intimate countless times, their &quot;friends with benefits&quot; relationship spanning several months. Now, she was helping him get ready for a date with another woman, in the very place where they'd shared so much together. The irony was almost too much to bear.
Evan chatted happily, oblivious to Patti's inner turmoil. &quot;Sarah's so excited about this event. I just hope I don't embarrass her.&quot;
&quot;You won't,&quot; Patti assured him, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. Just keep smiling. Keep being the friend he needs.
Her fingers finished the knot, and she stepped back, admiring her work. &quot;There, perfect.&quot;
Evan beamed, his nervousness replaced by excitement. &quot;Thanks, Patti! You're a lifesaver.&quot;
He hugged her tightly, gratitude in his eyes. Patti returned the hug, her face buried in his shoulder. This is how it should be. This is how it has to be.
They parted, and Evan's eyes sparkled with anticipation. &quot;I think tonight's going to be special.&quot;
Patti smiled, her inner struggle hidden behind a mask of support. &quot;I know it will be.&quot;
As she spoke, her eyes watered, and a single tear dropped from each eye. Evan noticed and his face transformed from excitement to concern.
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asked, his voice filled with worry.
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Patti choked out, the lie tasting bitter in her mouth.
Evan pulled her into a warm hug, a gesture that brought both comfort and torture. For the first time, something in his eyes suggested that he was starting to understand. He pulled back, his gaze searching her face.
&quot;Are you okay with my relationship with Sarah?&quot; he asked, a hint of uncertainty in his voice.
Patti bit her lip, her heart aching with the truth she couldn't reveal. She deflected his question, forcing a smile. &quot;I'm just excited about your big night. That's why I'm crying.&quot;
Evan studied her for a moment, his eyes soft, but he seemed to accept her explanation. &quot;Thanks, Patti. You're the best.&quot;
He hugged her again, his embrace full of gratitude, but also something more — a newfound awareness that lingered in the back of his mind. Patti returned the hug, her feelings a mix of relief and yearning.
They parted, and Evan's eyes sparkled with anticipation once again. &quot;I think tonight's going to be special.&quot;
As Evan left the room, Patti lingered, her hand tracing the spot where she'd tied his tie. The moment was over, but the feelings lingered. She sighed, knowing that she'd made the right choice, but it didn't make it any easier.</Text>
            <Notes>POV:  Third person limited, deep (focusing on Name)
Setting:  Evan and Guido's apartment
Special instructions/Notes:
Evan is oblivious to the fact that Patti is conflicted. In Evan's mind, his intimate relationship with Patti has no impact on their solid friendship.
In the scene, have Evan struggle with his tie and become frustrated. Have Patti save the day by tying the tie for him.
As she ties a tie for him, use inner dialogue and deep POV to show the reader her inner struggle with this moment.
The scene should reflect Patti's struggle, but the reader should see that for Evan this is just a night he is nervous but excited about.</Notes>

            <Title>0105 Evan and Guido in the Quad</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan and Guido are playing Frisbee in the Quad. Evan decides to head to the library for extra study time to keep his grade point average above 3.0 – a promise he made to his sister Liz.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Quad at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign sprawled like a lush green carpet under the sun. Majestic oaks and maples lined its periphery, their leaves rustling softly in the gentle breeze. Students lounged on the grass, engrossed in their books or chatting animatedly in groups, while others meandered along the pathways. The sky was a canvas of vivid blue, and the sun painted everything with a golden hue. It was the kind of morning that infused the soul with energy, and the Quad pulsated with the vibrancy of college life.
&quot;Hey, Evan! Think fast!&quot; Guido shouted, sending the Frisbee soaring toward Evan with a wicked curve.
Evan moved effortlessly, intercepting the disc with a graceful leap. &quot;Man, you're getting rusty!&quot; he called out, his voice dripping with mock derision.
Guido laughed, adjusting his cap. &quot;Maybe if you spent as much time on the field as you do in the library, you'd have a challenge here.&quot;
Evan smirked, &quot;Trying to get on Liz's good side, you know. A promise is a promise.&quot; He tossed the Frisbee back, his mind briefly flitting to his sister's encouraging smile. 
&quot;Ah, the great Evan Vaughn, tamed by a promise to his sister,&quot; Guido teased, catching the disc. &quot;You know, most guys are trying to escape the library, not run toward it.&quot;
Evan chuckled, picking up his backpack from the grass. &quot;She believes in me, man. I don't want to let her down. Besides,&quot; he winked, &quot;some of us need to hit the books to keep up. Not all of us have your natural... charm.&quot;
Guido feigned a dramatic gasp. &quot;I'll take that as a compliment.&quot; 
With a final laugh and wave, Evan began his departure from the Quad, energized by the day's perfection and a commitment he intended to honor. The playful banter with Guido still echoing in his mind, the path ahead felt light and hopeful.</Text>

            <Title>0122 Evan is a Man With a Plan</Title>
            <Text>Evan maneuvered his aged Subaru down the university streets, the compact SUV humming with the consistency only an old reliable car could offer. The sun painted a fresh coat of brightness over the day, streaks of light dancing on the dashboard, the weather reminiscent of the day he'd met Sarah. An energetic tune played from the radio, matching his cheerful demeanor. He found himself tapping along, humming the lyrics under his breath, the Cubs' three-game winning streak and yesterday's softball victory lending an extra beat to his rhythm. 
Infused with inspiration from his sister, Evan woke up Monday with an idea burning bright in his mind. It was as if the universe had conspired overnight, offering him a hint, a spark of insight that felt like the missing piece of a complex puzzle. He'd remembered Sarah's scholarly attire, her intelligent aura. He'd speculated she might be a bookworm. And where do bookworms hide? He laughed at the obviousness of it all. The library.
An air of confidence billowed around Evan, his chest swelled with newfound hope. He wasn't going to wait around, moping, and hoping for her appearance. If she wasn't at their first meeting spot, he'd plunge into the depths of the undergrad library, the refuge of bookworms and study enthusiasts. His gut feeling told him he'd find her there.
Pulling into a parking spot, Evan cut the engine, letting the last few notes of the energetic song fade. He opened the car door, a rush of early fall air filling his lungs, crisp with the promise of new beginnings. There was an excited skip to his step, an ease in his manner as he locked the vehicle and turned towards the library. His heart held no room for anxiety, only a serene confidence. He was a man with a plan. He felt like he was walking in stride with destiny itself, and it was impossible not to share in his assurance. With one last deep breath, he set off, ready to conquer the day.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Katie’s hairdresser gives Sarah a makeover.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah and Katie found themselves pausing as they stepped into the expansive, cutting-edge apartment. The atmosphere was a harmonious blend of lavish extravagance and sophisticated minimalism, reflected in the streamlined furniture and immaculate spaces. Unimpeded by clutter, the stunning panorama from the floor-to-ceiling windows stood out prominently. Awestruck, Katie's gaze swept across the interiors, soaking up every exquisite detail.
&quot;Wow, this place is amazing! How many bedrooms are there?&quot; The question resonated in the expansive space.
&quot;Two,&quot; Sarah's response came as a quiet murmur.
&quot;Is your roommate home?&quot; Katie inquired, her visual exploration of the apartment ongoing.
Sarah negated with a shake of her head. &quot;I don’t have a roommate. It’s just me.&quot;
Katie's eyes widened in surprise. &quot;No roommate? You must be rich.&quot;
&quot;My father is,&quot; Sarah shrugged. &quot;He owns a large corporation. He wanted me to have an extra bedroom that I could use as an office. I usually work at the dining room table, or in my bedroom.&quot;
The idea of privacy, the luxury of space, left Katie yearning. &quot;I can’t even imagine what it’s like not to have to share a room. It makes it impossible to study.&quot;
A silence settled between them, dense and tangible. Sarah watched as Katie's gaze took another spin around the room before she extended a friendly hand. &quot;If you like, you can use my place if you need to study for a big test or just need some quiet time.&quot;
&quot;Really! Thank you!&quot; With those words, Katie lunged forward and gave Sarah a big hug, the latter taken by surprise but welcoming the warmth.
Katie broke the hug, her eyes twinkling with an idea. &quot;I scheduled an appointment with my stylist. She asked me to send a picture, so she can get an idea of what she might want to do.&quot;
Katie asked, “So, tell me about the guy you’re dating tonight. What’s his name? How did you meet?&quot;
Sarah's features softened and brightened at the mention of Evan. &quot;His name is Evan. He saved me from falling on some steps. I don’t know what came over me, but the way he looked at me and told me he wanted to kiss me... I couldn’t help myself.&quot;
&quot;So, did you kiss?&quot; Katie asked, her face lighting up.
A small smile adorned Sarah's lips. &quot;Yes, we did! Katie, I’ve never experienced anything like that. It was like this other version of myself took over my body, and it felt incredible. My body was vibrating for hours afterward. Evan said the universe meant for us to meet like that.&quot;
Katie's exclamation of delight filled the room as she clapped her hands together. Her admiration for the romantic gesture was palpable. 
As Katie was about to open her mouth to dive into another subject, the familiar buzz of her cell phone diverted her attention. She quickly glanced at the screen, her eyebrows arching slightly. &quot;Oh, it's Nicole, my hairstylist,&quot; she explained. &quot;She wants to confirm our appointment and she needs a picture of you to start making a plan for your makeover.&quot;
Sarah blinked in surprise but then smiled in response. &quot;Alright, let's do it.&quot;
Katie quickly captured a picture of Sarah, her fingers flying over the phone as she sent the image to Nicole. Within moments, Nicole responded with a flurry of excited emojis, already expressing her eagerness to work on Sarah's transformation. 
Katie asked, &quot;So altogether, including new clothes and hairstylist, what kind of budget are we talking?&quot; 
&quot;No budget constraints, you're in charge!&quot; Sarah said with a playful grin.
Katie's eyes lit up at this and she squealed, clapping her hands in excitement. &quot;Really? Oh, this is going to be so much fun!&quot;
The energy in the room was effervescent, reflecting off Sarah as her own excitement began to bubble up. It was new, this anticipation of a date, of being made over, of possibly breaking her own rules, but it was an invigorating feeling that Sarah welcomed.
Katie, full of curiosity, veered the conversation towards Sarah's dating past. &quot;You said it had been a while since you dated?&quot; She was already conjuring up different makeovers in her mind, ready to transform Sarah for her date.
Sarah grinned, a surprising lightness in her tone. &quot;I haven’t dated since I was 16.&quot;
&quot;16? Wowza!&quot; Katie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. But she wasn't done probing, her next question laced with a touch of delicacy. &quot;If you don’t mind me asking, are you a...&quot; She paused, &quot;virgin?&quot;
&quot;No, I’m not a virgin,&quot; Sarah confessed, the hesitation barely noticeable. &quot;I experimented for a short time in high school, but I didn't see what was so great about it.&quot;
Katie leaned in closer, her voice a comforting whisper. &quot;It will be way different when you find the right guy.” 
A mischievous twinkle lit up in Sarah's eyes, an expression that silently echoed, &quot;Maybe!?&quot; This was a different Sarah, one who was open to the possibility of something more, something exciting, something like... Evan.
Seizing the moment, Katie ventured to ask, &quot;Do you think Evan may be the right guy?&quot;
The response was immediate, Sarah's smile reaching her eyes as she raised her eyebrows. &quot;He's the right guy if he makes love even half as good as he kisses!&quot; 

Their giggles echoed around the room, the atmosphere brimming with anticipation and the sheer joy of newfound possibilities. The girls were truly ready for a night that promised to be a roller coaster of emotions and revelations.
Katie's head tilted slightly, a silent question in her eyes. The puzzle of how a date came to be from a runner's flight was intriguing. Sarah's words offered the missing piece; Evan had sought her out in the library, persistent and charming. Despite her best attempts to stay true to her policy, she found herself succumbing to the magnetic pull of Evan's appeal.
A knowing smile danced on Katie's lips as she watched Sarah's face transform, a touch of red gracing her cheeks. It was evident; the rule, the policy Sarah had held on to so firmly, had been fractured. A spark of defiance lit up in her eyes, an implicit admission of breaking her no-dating policy.
Katie's features softened into a warm, knowing smile. &quot;So you decided to step beyond your no-dating policy?&quot; Her tone carried no judgment; instead, it was rich with approval, almost as if she had been waiting for Sarah to allow herself this freedom.
Sarah shrugged, a hint of sheepishness creeping into her features. &quot;I didn’t have a choice. Every time he kisses me, I can’t think straight. Since the moment I met him, I haven’t been able to study or focus on anything. All I think about is him. Maybe this date will help clear my mind.&quot;
&quot;Are you worried this might develop into something more?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes glinting with mischief.
&quot;I have thought a lot about that. If I could find a way to have a relationship with Evan without being distracted from my work, I would like that. The thought of having someone by my side when attending an event or someone to hang out with here at home, appeals to me. But, I have a feeling it’s not going to be that simple.&quot;
Katie nodded, taking in Sarah's words. &quot;Well, if you ask me, I think you are doing the right thing. You can't let your studies keep you from living your life. There is always a way to make things work. You just have to find your balance.&quot;
The author's style used in writing this scene: Character-driven narrative with a dash of dialogue-driven exposition. The description serves to enhance the setting, and character interaction is used to reveal their personalities, motivations, and background.</Text>

            <Notes>Maybe have a coffee or drink offer from Sarah
Maybe rewrite the first paragraph


Let's expand and animate this part of the scene. I can see Katie awestruck in real life when she walks into a luxury apartment, but to Sarah, it's commonplace. 
While Katie pauses and marvels at this place, maybe walks to the window and looks out the window, Sarah would likely veer off in a separate direction to her kitchen and get something to drink – perhaps wine or coffee or water. In contrast to Sarah, Katie might tell Sarah how great the department is, maybe how incredible the view is. Sarah might offer her something to drink, as anyone would when a new guest comes to their apartment. 
Have Katie accept the drink, and then have Sarah tell Katie to have a seat on her couch. Sarah can then bring her drink to her, sit down and start their chat.
Here are a couple of things to note as you rebuild the first part of this scene. Champaign, Illinois is a small town, so there won't be any extensive city views. If you describe the view out the window, let's have Sarah's apartment look out into an expansive preservation area—lots of trees and greenery with a small appealing creek running through the nature preserve.
I want to start the scene with the reader feeling like there with Sarah and Katie. Right now, it feels like they're just two people talking anywhere. I want to immerse the reader into the scene.
Please rewrite and expand that first paragraph if that's enough to work with. If you need more information, let me know. Were brainstorming here, you have free reign to express your thoughts and ideas.</Notes>

            <Text>For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, their first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is underway. They've never met, as their social circles don't intersect. Evan, a charismatic, athletic young man, commands popularity not by choice but by virtue of his outgoing personality. Despite his natural allure, he remains grounded thanks to the guidance from his saintly sister, Liz, treating everyone with kindness.
Evan isn't the most diligent student, preferring the outdoors to the confines of classrooms and libraries. However, to uphold a promise to Liz, he's striving for a minimum GPA of 3.0. As he enters his senior year, his grades are teetering on this threshold, and he is compelled to trade Frisbee games for study sessions at the undergrad library.
Contrastingly, Sarah is a stellar student, poised to graduate at the top of her class. As a business major and teaching assistant, she considers the library her sanctuary, often losing herself in riveting audio seminars, like one on international business strategies. One day, engrossed in her seminar, she realizes she's running late for a class she's teaching. In her rush, she neglects her surroundings and dashes towards a flight of stairs without a handrail.
Evan, heading her way, spots the impending accident. He calls out to her, but she doesn't hear him. He dashes to intercept her before she reaches the stairs, catching her just in time. This unexpected encounter leads to a spontaneous, passionate kiss. 
Sarah, brought up with a single-minded focus on academics and preparing to take over her father's business, has little experience with romance. She had sworn off any romantic entanglements until she completed her Master’s degree and embarked on her professional journey. 
In a whirlwind, Sarah leaves without providing Evan her name or contact. Later, Evan manages to track her down, returning a pair of glasses she had left behind and charming her into taking a break at the food court. Despite her initial hesitation, she gives in to Evan’s allure. 
Their encounter at the food court leaves Sarah questioning herself as she witnesses Evan’s popularity, especially among the female students. Feeling out of place, she retreats, but Evan convinces her to agree to a date. Uncertain about dating norms, Sarah enlists the help of one of her top students, Katie, to modernize her look and prep her for the date. 
During their date, Sarah proposes a business-like arrangement with Evan, setting rules and expectations and prioritizing her academics. Evan, who has been smitten since their first encounter, happily agrees. As they continue to see each other, Sarah allows herself to experience romance and affection, while Evan becomes a better student with Sarah’s help. 
Their senior year unfolds beautifully. Sarah expands her social circle, and Evan lands a good job in Chicago. As graduation approaches, however, Sarah grapples with her future choices – Ivy League schools for her Master's or staying with Evan. Unbeknownst to her, Evan plans to propose at the graduation party, inviting her parents for the surprise.
Sarah, who has downplayed the seriousness of their relationship to her parents, is taken aback by Evan’s proposal. She fears disappointing her father by deviating from her initial plan. Following the party, her father presents her with two choices – follow Evan to Chicago and build a life there, or stick to the original plan of pursuing her Master's and eventually joining her father’s business. If she chooses Evan, her father will cut off financial support.
Sarah is torn between her love for Evan and her commitment to her father. Despite the complexities, her heart prevails, and she chooses to build a life with Evan in Chicago. Sarah and Evan elope. 
While all indications are the happy couple is excited and ready to start a life together, all may not be as it seems.
After a quick marriage ceremony, and Sarah and Evan are officially married, Sarah retreats to the lady’s restroom. Stonefaced, she stares at herself in the mirror and asks herself, &quot;Oh my god. What have I done!?&quot;</Text>

Scene Name: Sarah &amp; Evan’s First Date
Summary: Sarah and Evan meet for their first official date at an Asian restaurant. Seeking to set the groundwork for their relationship, Sarah lays out certain conditions. To her delight, Evan happily agrees, marking a new phase in their connection.
Characters: Sarah, Evan
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Thai Garden Restaurant
Tone: Exciting, hopeful, anticipatory, friendly
Weather: Partly cloudy and nice outside.
Special Instructions:

Use the narrative to enhance the existing VERBATIM dialogue, emphasizing character emotions, internal thoughts, and the setting as necessary. However, ensure the dialogue remains the central mechanism for moving the plot forward.
Integrate dialogue tags an action tags at your full discretion. 
Remove all speaker labels identified by the character name followed by a colon and a space. Example &quot;Sarah: &quot;
In this heavy dialogue, keep the characters moving, doing something with their hands – some sort of background activity to keep the scene flowing. I always want my readers to feel like there in the scene, not watching the scene.
Character Arcs for This Scene: 
Sarah:  Sarah was intent on not making any decisions based on emotion. She came ready to go with the plan that she thought would be a win-win for both of them. 
It never occurred to her, one way or another, how Evan would respond to her contract negotiation approach. Because to her that was a very normal natural way to handle the situation. 
Like her father taught her, Sarah took control of the negotiations and, in her mind, keep control. While she was thinking Evan was going to negotiate with her, Evan was just amused by the whole thing. There was just something about Sarah that Evan found so unique and so adorable.
Sarah was thrown off guard when Evan did not counter her proposal. She never did seem to understand that, he just wants to be with her. All that other stuff that she's worried about doesn't matter at all to him.
While Sarah started the date with the business mindset. As soon as Evan agrees, the energy of the night changes. Now she can relax and just embrace a relationship with Evan. 
As will find out in the next scene, the date ends not like business negotiation, but in full romance and sentimentality. Leaving even Sarah shedding happy tears. Which shocks her to her core. But, at least for this night, for the first time she feels like a normal woman. A feeling she never wanted to feel like before, but now feels better than anything she's ever felt.
However, in this scene we only get a hint of that at the end. 
Evan: Evan's Mark is fairly simple for this scene. Evan &quot;is all&quot; in before Sarah even gets there. He's smitten with her and there is not much she could say that would dissuade him. 
Throughout the dinner Evan is Evan. He liked to joke a lot, he likes to complement Sarah, he treats her well. He adores every word that comes out of her mouth.
This would be true no matter what she said. However, Evan actually loves Sarah's approach to this state. He always felt that the whole courtship process was fake. People would treat each other nice until they got what they wanted and they would start taking each other for granted.
While Sarah's business-style contract negotiation approach to starting a relationship would send most men running for the hills. Evan thinks it's a great idea.
Starting a relationship on the same page. Skipping the whole fake recording process. Instead, just lay everything on the table at the beginning. He wondered why our relationships shouldn't start this way. 
He starts the date ready to be in relationship with Sarah, and ends the date glad that he's in a relationship with Sarah. 
Draft Scene:
[[This is the one and only time that this location will be the setting in the story. Whenever I introduce a new location, I like to start the scene off with a description as the characters enter the scene. Use the &quot;Setting: &quot; marker in this template for a detailed description.]]
[[Sarah stood outside the Thai Garden Restaurant on Kirby Avenue. Through the window, she could see Evan texting on his phone. Sarah felt terrified. Sarah was used to controlling her emotions and actions, yet here she was, feeling incapable of walking away and maintaining her no dating policy. However, even an emotional Sarah was never truly out of control. She came with a well-thought-out plan.
Evan waited anxiously, trying to find someone to text to help pass the time. He felt a presence over his shoulder and looked up, then look back to his phone. A second later, he looked back again, realizing it was Sarah.]]
 [[ Seeing it was Sarah brought a smile to his face. Evan stood up, kissed Sarah. ]]
Evan: “I almost didn’t recognize you. Did you do all this for me?” 
[[ Referring to her makeover. ]]
Sarah: “I was in the mood to change things up a bit.”
Evan: “Looking for a change, are you? I hope that bodes well for me.”
Sarah: [[Sarah moved her eyes up and to the right, donned a sly grin]] “We’ll see.”
Evan: [[Evan laughed.]] “Let’s go eat!”
Sarah: [[When they got to the table, Evan pulled out the seat for Sarah.]] “Thank you. You are quite the gentleman.”
Evan: “You look great! But you know you’d didn’t have to change anything for me. You are beautiful now, you're just as beautiful as when I first laid eyes on you.”
“Server:” [[Their server appeared just as Evan finished his complement.]] “Welcome to the Thai Garden. May I start you off with something to drink?”
Sarah: “I'll have a glass of Pinot Noir’.”
Evan: “Make that two.&quot; 
[[Sarah and Evan took a few minutes to discuss the menu and were ready to order when their server returned. Evan went with the Spicy Pad Thai, and Sarah settled on the Kao Pai.]]
Evan: “I was worried you wouldn’t show up.&quot;
Sarah: “I told you I always keep my appointments.&quot;
Evan: “I was hoping you would think of this as a date and not an appointment.”
Sarah: “Sorry, poor choice of words. Why don’t we start this date off with you telling me a little about yourself?” 
Evan:  &quot;Now, are you looking for my full résumé, complete with professional references, or just a summary of my many academic achievements?&quot;
[[ Sarah's eyes sparkled as she caught the joke. Even though it was a playful jab at her, she found it endearing. His sense of humor put her at ease. ]]
[[ Sarah laughed ]]
Sarah: &quot;Ha ha, you're so funny! I promise, no more résumé recitations. Let's stick to the topics that are normally disclosed on a first date.&quot;
Evan:  &quot;Deal,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with genuine enthusiasm. &quot;Let's make this a night to remember.&quot;
[[ Sarah's heart gave a little leap, and a warm, pleasurable sensation spread through her. She was beginning to feel truly comfortable with him, and the night seemed full of promise. With a smile, she reached out and clinked her glass to his, toasting to the sentiment. ]]
Evan: “Well, I’m a pretty simple guy. I work as a personal trainer at the gym down the street. I like to play sports, hike, run, bike, anything that gets me outside. I enjoy hanging out with my friends. Anything else you want to know?”
Sarah: “What’s your major? Are you a good student?”
Evan: “I’m majoring in software development. I guess I’m a good student when I apply myself. At least, that’s what my sister would say. I promised her I would maintain at least a 3.0 GPA. I'm hovering around that GPA now.”
Sarah: “Are you close to your sister?” 
Evan: “Yes, but right now, she’s in Chicago, so I don’t get to see her as often as I like. That’s where I’m from. How about you? What’s your story? Where are you from?
Sarah: “I grew up in Seattle, no siblings. I’m a business major with a focus on international trade, a teacher’s assistant, and I'm in the running for graduating at the top of our class.
“If you don’t mind me asking, I get the impression that you could’ve gone to any university you wanted to. Why would you pick the University of Illinois?”
Sarah: “My father owns a multimillion-dollar corporation. He was a self-made man from modest beginnings. He and my mother went to U of I, and our agreement was I would follow in his footsteps, get my Bachelor’s degree here. After graduation, I plan to attend a prestigious East Coast University for my master’s degree.
This plan has the extra benefit of making new contacts in the Midwest and the East Coast. My father stresses how important it is to make as many business contacts as possible.”
Evan: “Are you going to work with him after you get your master’s degree?”
Sarah: “Not right away. The idea is to gain experience with a large international corporation, and then in 5 to 7 years, join my father’s company in an executive position. By the time he is ready to retire, I should have enough experience to take over as CEO.”
Evan: “That’s very interesting. Do you have a job?”
[[Their food arrived, pausing the conversation.]]
Sarah: “This food looks and smells delicious!” [[Sarah took a bite.]] “It even tastes better than it looks. Excellent choice of restaurants!”
Evan: “I don’t get to come here very often, but I love their food.&quot; 
[[Evan said as he ate his meal.]]
 Sarah: [[continued their conversation]] “I don’t have a paying job, but I do volunteer as an events coordinator for various nonprofit organizations in the area. During summer breaks, I stay in Chicago and volunteer there.”
Evan: “That’s admirable.”
Sarah: “My father also stresses the importance of philanthropic work. He says it’s good to give back to the community and a great way to meet other like-minded people.”
Evan: “That makes sense. What do you do for fun?”
Sarah: “I do nothing for fun per se. However, I go to a lot of business socials, fundraisers, and academic seminars.”
Evan: “Let me guess. So you can make more contacts!”
Sarah: “You find me one-dimensional, don’t you?”
Evan: “I'm quite impressed with what you have told me. I like the idea of getting involved with non-profit organizations. It just seems like you should allow some time for fun.”
Sarah:: [[ grinned and reminded Evan ]] “I’m here with you, aren’t I?” 
Evan: “Yes, you are! I'm happy about that.”
[[As they continued to eat, Evan and Sarah chitchatted about a variety of subjects. The conversation flowed well, and Sarah surmised Evan was more intelligent than she might have given him credit for. She determined he would make a quality companion and convinced herself it was based on analysis and not physical or emotional attraction.
Sarah ordered a small espresso, while Evan ordered a piece of cheesecake for dessert. Sarah shared her thoughts while Evan ate his dessert.]]
Sarah: “I was wondering if I could make a proposal?”
Evan: “A proposal already? We just met.&quot; joked Evan. “Go ahead; I’m all ears.”
 Sarah: “Since I met you, I have been reconsidering my thoughts on relationships. A relationship is a partnership. I wanted to propose that we form a partnership. In business, it is essential to identify all foreseeable issues before signing an agreement.
“My father taught me it is best to lead with what I have to offer first, and here is what I can provide to this partnership. I can teach you some study techniques to improve your grades with minimal effort. As a romantic partner, I can already tell you’re going to want me to break out of my shell and socialize with your friends and others in my age group. I can’t promise that I'll attend every party or social event, but I'll accompany you as often as I can, and if there is a particular event that is important to you, I’ll try to attend.
“As adults in a romantic relationship, I expect there will be some physical intimacy involved. I want to be honest with you here. I'm not a virgin, but I'm also not very experienced. I haven't been on a date since I was 16 years old.
“You are quite attractive, and I'm interested in pursuing a physical relationship. I'll need you to be patient, as I explore that aspect of myself. I expect you to wait until I'm ready.”
Evan interrupted. “May I ask a question?” [[Sarah nodded, and Evan continued]], “I play softball every Sunday morning. Will you be able to come to my games?”
Sarah: “My schedule is usually clear on Sunday mornings. I should be able to make it to many of your games.”
Evan: [[Having Sarah at his games was an important point for Evan, evidenced by the excited look on his face.]]  “Continue with your proposal.”
Sarah: [[continued]] “The most important thing to me is that you understand my academic career comes first. That means no pressuring me to go to parties or spend time together until after I’ve attended to my studies.
“I attend a lot of formal events. Just as I'll attend your social events, I shall expect the same in return. Keep in mind these aren’t frat parties.”
Evan: “Is that what you think I'm, a frat boy?”
Sarah: “I didn’t mean to imply that. I just want to let you know you may have to dress up for some of these events. These events will also be a great way for you to make contacts. The more contacts you have, the better chance you will get the job you want when you graduate.”
Evan: “Here we go again with the contacts.&quot;
Sarah: “It’s not just that. I like you. It would honor me to have you by my side at any event. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you since the moment you kissed me. If we let our relationship develop organically, I may never regain my focus.”
Evan: “I feel the same. You’ve been the only thing on my mind for the last week. I can’t focus any better than you can. There’s something about you that is just so different and so special. It’s like somehow, I already know it’s going to work out. There’s nothing I want more than to bypass the whole dating phase and call you my girlfriend.”
Sarah: “That’s my proposal then. Do you have a counter-proposal?” 
[[Evan had no problem with Sarah’s less than romantic offer and voiced his approval.]]
Evan:  “No counter-proposal. I’m in total agreement!”
Sarah: [[laughed]] “My father said if they accept your first offer, you offered too much.”
Evan: “Look at it from my point of view. You said you would attend my games, you plan to explore your sexuality with me when you’re ready, you are going to hook me up with potential employers, and you can help me get good grades, which will make my sister happy. What more could I ask for?”
[[Sarah put out her hand for a handshake.]] 
Sarah: “So we have a deal?”
Evan: “No way are we sealing this deal with a handshake.&quot;
[[What Evan is implying, not so subtly, is that it's time to leave the restaurant because he wants to seal the deal with a kiss.]]
[[He called for the check, paid it, and escorted Sarah out of the restaurant.]]

Leading Context:
Summary of the previous scene:
In the seclusion of a small private storage room, Sarah takes a moment to prepare Evan for the impending fundraiser. With a mix of excitement and concern, she instructs him to mind his P’s and Q’s, particularly around her boss, Marcus Chamberlain, who bears a striking resemblance to Morgan Freeman. Her guidance is filled with both faith in Evan’s abilities and anxiety about how the evening will unfold, setting the stage for what promises to be an unforgettable event.

POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)
Dialogue Focus: Moderate
Use of Internal Dialogue: Heavy
Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
[ Mere seconds into their journey, Evan spots Marcus Chamberlain. Unable to resist his comic ways. ]
Evan: “Hey Sarah, Morgan Freeman showed up!”
Sarah: “Shh, Evan, someone might hear you. Don’t look at him. We need to warm you up a bit before I introduce you.”
[ Marcus Chamberlain looked over at Sarah and Evan and began walking their way. ]
Evan: “Too late. Morgan is on his way. Should I ask for his autograph?”
[ Sarah was not amused by Evan’s jokes. She immediately flashed a smile she’s been practicing since she attended her first fundraiser at 12 years old. Out of the corner of her mouth. ]
Sarah [ whispered ]: “Be on your best behavior.”
Middle:
[ Marcus walks up and praises Sarah. ]
Marcus: “Sarah, you’ve done a great job here. I’m very impressed!”
Sarah: “Thank you, Mr. Chamberlain-”
[ Marcus interrupted and corrected her ]
Marcus: “Please, not so formal. Call me Marcus.”
Sarah: “Thank you, Marcus, for trusting me with such a prestigious event. I am honored to be associated with your organization.”
[ Curiously, Marcus looks at Evan. ]
Marcus: “Ah, a new face. Who have you brought with you today?”
Sarah: “This is my boyfriend, Evan?”
[ Marcus extends his hand. ]
Marcus: “Nice to meet you, Evan.”
[ Marcus and Evan engage in a firm, appropriate handshake. ]
Evan: “A pleasure to meet you as well, Marcus.”
[ Sarah feels good about how the conversation with Marcus and Evan started. ]
Marcus: “So, your Sarah’s boyfriend?”
Evan smiled: “My proudest accomplishment to date!”
[ Evan’s response caused Sarah concern, but Marcus chuckled. ]
Marcus: “Have you had a chance to look at the items up for auction?”
Evan: “I took a quick peek on my way into the ballroom. I’d give my right arm for those Bears tickets on the 50-yard line!”
[Sarah’s concern notched up to minor anxiety. She was trying to figure out how to silently remind Evan to speak more professionally. ]
Marcus: “Are you a Bears fan?”
[ Evan didn’t say anything. But with wide-open eyes made an exaggerated nod yes. ]
[ Evan’s animated facial expression and exaggerated nod increased Sarah’s concern and anxiety. ]
[ Marcus chuckled again. ]
Marcus: “It’s a blind auction. I think bidding starts in a few minutes. Who knows, maybe you’ll have the winning bid.”
[ Unaware that Sarah was dying of anxiety inside, hoping he didn’t say anything that would offend Marcus, Evan continued his comic ways. ]
Evan: “You see this suit? It’s nice, isn’t it?”
[ Evan talked on the lapels of his suit jacket as part of his humorist ways. ]
[ Marcus looked a bit confused. ]
Marcus: “Quite nice, yes.”
Evan [ joked ]: “I would love to bid on those tickets, but this suit represents the last dollar in my bank account.”
[ Although Evan’s statement was meant to be humorous, it was also very true. He drained his bank account for his fundraiser ensemble. ]
[ Sarah’s anxiety was nearing a crescendo. She just wanted to disappear. She couldn’t believe that Evan was joking in a situation like this, but then something unexpected happened. Marcus cracked up at Evan’s joke. ]
Marcus: “Sarah, I love this guy. He’s hilarious!”
[ Sarah remained paralyzed in her smile, unsure how to respond. ]
Marcus: “I understand. I was young and always short on cash back in the day. But you know our organization does great work. Would you consider donating your time? We are always short on volunteers.”
Evan: “I would love to help out! Sarah told me about the great work ‘Home Is Where the Heart Is’ does.”
[ Evan’s statement slightly notched down Sarah’s anxiety. She thought now he was getting back on track. ]
[ Evan was proud of himself (in a cute way) that he remembered the name. ]
Marcus: “I’m glad to hear that! Sarah can give you the details. She’s in charge of the project. Two weeks from today, we’ll be helping folks clean up what’s left after a tornado hit a town not far from where Sarah lives. Do you think you can make it that Saturday?”
Evan: “Count me in! I’m sure I can recruit a handful of friends to help volunteer as well.”
[ Sarah finally found her voice. Her anxiety was decreased – at least for the moment. She was excited that Evan would volunteer and recruit his friends. ]
Sarah: “Really? Who do you think will come?”
[ Evan rubbed his chin and thought. ]
Evan: “Patti is a lock! This is right up her alley, and wherever Patti goes, Roxanne goes. I’m sure I can get Guido to commit, and I think I could convince three or four more friends to help out.”
Sarah: “Guido? I wouldn’t think he’d be interested in volunteering.”
[ Sarah was surprised that Evan thought Guido would have any interest in volunteering on a project like this. ]
[ Evan looked at Marcus, half serious,  half joking. ]
Evan: “Will there be single adult females volunteering?”
[ Marcus sees where Evan is going with this. He chuckled and played along. ]
Marcus: “I’m sure there will be plenty.”
Evan: “That’s a great incentive. We’ll add a six-pack of beer for a job well done, and Guido will be in!”
[ Sarah wanted to crawl under a rock. She was certain this was not an appropriate thing to say to Marcus. But as before, the unexpected happened. ]
[ Marcus laughed even louder than he had before. ]
Marcus: “I can’t wait to meet this Guido fella.”
[ Evan comically rolled his eyes ]
Evan: “Believe me, you can wait.”
[ Marcus laughed even harder. His eyes began to water. Evan laughed along with him. ]
[ Finally, Sarah let go of her fear. The conversation was not only going well but well beyond her expectations. ]
Marcus: “Sarah, has the bidding started yet on the auction items?”
Sarah: “In 10 minutes?”
Marcus: “I’ll tell you what, young Evan. If you can recruit a few friends and at least one Guido, the Bears tickets are yours.”
[ Evan was shocked, thrilled, excited, grateful. He profusely thanked Marcus. ]
Evan: “Are you sure?”
Marcus: “I’m positive. A handful of young volunteers is worth much more than we’ll get at auction for those tickets.”
[ Marcus turned to Sarah. ]
Marcus: “Can you pull the Bears tickets off the auction table?”
[ Sarah didn’t know what to think or say. But they were his Bears tickets. He could do as he pleased. ]
Sarah: “I’ll go pull them right now.”
End: 
[Before Marcus answers Evan’s question, he calls to Sarah, who is just started walking away. ]
Marcus: “Sarah, those are valuable tickets. Put them somewhere safe.”
[ Sarah turns to Marcus and nods confirmation.]
[ Marcus then continues to answer Evan’s question humorously. ]
Marcus: “Decent quarterback? The Bears? Probably in the year 2000 never?”
[ Both men laughed, and other men started joining the conversation, talking about the Bear’s quarterback woes and other sports-related topics. ]
[ As Sarah left, their voices faded into the background. ]
Objectives/Goals:
This scene shows Sarah realizing that Evan can still be himself and fit into her world. This goes a long way in whittling Sarah’s remaining resistance to going all in on the relationship.
Props/Items:
Bears tickets

Scene Name: Sarah Relents and agrees to a date
Summary: After catching up with Sarah outside the food court, Evan continues to engage her. Despite her initial reluctance, Sarah's resistance weakens, and she agrees to go on a date with Evan later in the week, a notable development in their budding relationship.
Characters: Evan, Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Locations: Outside on the campus of the University of Illinois, somewhere between the food court and the parking lot.
Time of Day: Morning
Tone: Sweet, funny, intriguing, exciting, frantic. The scene has a bit of all emotion.
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
Special Instructions: 
This scene is essential because it shows Evan is more than muscles, lips, and charm. When Sarah makes yet another attempt to escape, and this time Evan stops her, they finally have a chance to talk.
Sarah is used to being the smartest person in the room, even amongst adults older than her. That being said, this shows that Evan can hold his own in a conversation with her. 
At first, Sarah's disoriented by Evan's ability to communicate with her so intelligently. Sarah found herself more attracted to Evan with every word he said. 
This may be very subtle in this scene, but Sarah begins to see that she could have a relationship with someone like Evan. Evan is someone not afraid to challenge her. She was impressed by how Evan was not intimidated by her IQ or GPA. 
But more than that, she felt herself changing in real time as she spoke to him. He brought a softer side out in her. He got her to think outside of her rigid box – thinking in ways she had never thought before.
If possible, or once they start talking outside the food court, see if you can build the attraction momentum as she becomes more and more attracted to him. Although she still resists. The attraction building is as much intellectual as it is physical. Sarah could have resisted Evan if the attraction was merely physical. The way to Sarah's heart is through her mind.
I've included a rough first draft. Here are a few items I need help with:
Please revise and enhance this scene, but prioritize preserving my original dialogue and structure as much as possible. I'm particularly interested in maintaining the authentic voice of my characters and the specific flow of the conversation.
What I like about this scene is how it escalates the scene before. In the prior scenes, Evan gets Sarah to agree to a 15-minute break. Now he gets her to agree to a date. As the scenes move forward, he successfully whittles away her resistance.
I like how this scene has multiple emotions. Try keeping those in the scene as much as possible.
There is no need for any full upfront vivid detail of the location/setting, but feel free to integrate into this heavy dialogue scene as needed. There outside on a breezy warm sunny day.
Remove all &quot;Evan:&quot; and &quot;Sarah:&quot; labels. Feel free to insert, modify, or remove dialogue tags and action tags at your discretion. Remember that I would like the dialogue to stay intact as much as possible.
Sequence of Events:
Evan: “Where are you going?” 
Evan was intent on not letting her get away again. He chased after her. 
Evan called her, “Hey, Cinderella, wait up, wait up!” before catching up with her.
She stopped and turned to him. “Why do you call me Cinderella?”
“Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”
“Why do you keep pursuing me? It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.” 
“I want to learn more about you. What’s wrong with that?”
“It doesn’t take a genius to see that we exist in different worlds.”
Evan laughed. “Let me guess. You’re a genius?”
“I do have a genius IQ, but that’s not my point.”
“What is your point?” he asked.
“As a couple, we make little sense. I came to college to get an education and network with professionals to further my academic and professional careers. I committed to focusing on my work and refraining from distracting relationships. You don’t need me. You must know every female on campus.”
Evan smiled. “Are you jealous? You have nothing to worry about.”
&quot;I’m not jealous. I simply can’t understand why you’re focusing your attention on me.&quot; Sarah asked, her arms crossed as she faced him, her eyes brimming with questions.
Evan looked at her, his eyes reflecting a mix of curiosity and genuine interest. &quot;I don't know, Sarah. There's just something about you. You're different from the girls I'm used to meeting.&quot;
&quot;You don't even know me,&quot; she countered, her voice softer than intended, her gaze shifting to the ground.
He nodded, acknowledging her point. &quot;That's true,&quot; he admitted, a breeze lifting a lock of his hair as he met her gaze again. &quot;But let me ask you something. Why did you kiss me? Why are you here with me now instead of studying?&quot;
She dropped her gaze to her feet, her foot tracing an absent pattern on the pavement. &quot;Other than the obvious…&quot; she began, implying Evan's good looks. Her voice tapered off to a whisper, &quot;I don't know either.&quot;
A persuasive plea etched in Evan's eyes as he stepped closer to her, the distance between them shrinking. &quot;Well, let's find out together,&quot; he said earnestly, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Go to dinner with me.”
Sarah remained silent, not ready to surrender, not prepared to escape.
Evan continued, “I understand the importance of education, but college is more than classes and exams. It’s about relationships, having fun, trying new things.”
“I promised my Father that typical college hijinks would not distract me.”
“Did your Father ask you not to build meaningful relationships?”
“No, not exactly. He advised me to stay focused.”
“Do you think he doesn’t want you to enjoy your college experience?”
“Of course, I don’t think that. He does say how important it is to be a well-rounded individual. But Evan, I made a plan that makes sense and has held to it for three years.”
“Doesn’t it make sense to enjoy your college life? Doesn’t it make sense, as you say, to be well-rounded? If so, doesn’t it make sense to pursue new relationships?”
Sarah was exasperated. She wasn’t used to someone challenging her perspective so effectively. “You have got my head spinning. It doesn’t help that every time you kiss me, my IQ drops 50 points. How can my plan make so much sense, yet your completely opposite approach makes sense too?”
“How can a piece of paper be both thin and wide?”
That statement made her think long enough for Evan to kiss her again.
He said, “I don’t work Thursday. Let’s have dinner away from campus. Do you like Thai food? The Thai Garden is a great place. It’s too expensive for your average college crowd, but it won’t break the bank. Thursday night, dinner at seven? It’s just one date. Let’s get to know each other.”
“Alright, I will meet you there at 7:30.”
Evan smacked his hand together. “That’s awesome! Can I get your phone number? Your Last Name?”
Sarah still had mixed feelings. “Let’s wait and see how it goes.”
“Do you have any plans now?”
“I am going to drive home and try to get some work done,” said Sarah.
Evan held out his hand. “May I walk you to your car?” 
Her breath returned to normal as she became more comfortable holding hands in public. When they got to her car, Evan asked, “May I get a kiss goodbye?”
“Of Course!”
After not being kissed for five years, she couldn’t get enough of Evan’s kisses. After a long make-out session, Evan asked, “How’s that IQ doing?”
Sarah made a rare joke, “2+2 equals 10.”
They laughed together as if it was the funniest joke ever told.
Evan said, “I’m afraid to let you go. I’m worried you won’t show up on Thursday.” 
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. I never break an appointment unless it’s an emergency.”</Text>

            <Text>Certainly! Here's the rewritten scene template:

Summary:
Christmas morning at Liz and Joe's apartment was filled with excitement as gifts were unwrapped. Evan's present to Liz, a first-semester report card with three A's and one B, showcased a GPA increase to 3.2 and symbolized his academic growth thanks to Sarah's help. The most poignant moment occurred when Joe gave Liz the final gift – an engagement ring, accompanying a heartfelt proposal that added a touch of romance to the festive celebration.

Leading Context:
The day after Christmas had arrived, and Evan and Sarah were packed and ready to head back to their college town. It had been a great Christmas day for everyone, with the joyous events including Liz accepting an engagement ring and proposal from Joe.

Setting:
Location: Joe and Liz's apartment in Glenview, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago.
Time: The day after Christmas, around 6 PM.
Weather/Environment: It was cold outside, but the city had cleared the snow from the roads, making it safe to drive.

Characters Present:
Main Characters: Liz, Joe, Sarah, Evan
Secondary Characters: None

Character Emotional State:
Liz: Liz and Joe were extremely excited because they had secretly eloped during the day and planned to reveal this to Evan and Sarah before they left.
Evan: Before Liz revealed her elopement, Evan felt a little down about having to return to his college town, Champaign, Illinois, so soon.
Sarah: On the outside, Sarah appeared neutral. To her, this day was like any other. On the inside, she was anxious to get back to her event planner duties for the busy holiday season.

Objectives/Goals:
The scene aimed to reveal Evan's excitement that Liz was now a married woman and his brother-in-law was a man he respected, Joe. It also captured Evan's disappointment that he had to leave so soon. Normally, he would stay longer for Christmas, but Sarah needed to get back for her work.</Text>

            <Title>WIP</Title>
            <Text>Sarah's steps were brisk against the sidewalk, but she wasn't quick enough. She heard Evan calling out behind her, his tone playfully admonishing, &quot;Hey, Cinderella, wait up!&quot;
Turning back, she faced him, perplexed. &quot;Why do you call me Cinderella?&quot;
Evan's easy smile danced in the sunlight, his eyes bright with humor. &quot;Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”
&quot;And why are you so adamant about chasing after me?&quot; she countered. &quot;It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.&quot;
Evan stated, standing tall. &quot;I want to learn more about you. What’s wrong with that?”
&quot;It doesn’t take a genius to see that we exist in different worlds,” Sarah said with a huff.
His laughter was unexpected. “Let me guess. You’re a genius?”
“That’s not my point.”
Evan tilted his head, patient. “Then what is your point?”
“As a couple, we make little sense. I came to college to get an education and network with professionals to further my academic and professional careers. I committed to focusing on my work and refraining from distracting relationships. You don’t need me. You must know every female on campus.”

A persuasive plea etched in Evan's eyes as he stepped closer to her, the distance between them shrinking. &quot;Well, let's find out together,&quot; he said earnestly, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Go to dinner with me.”
She was silent. Then, when the silence had stretched too long, Evan added, “College is about relationships, having fun, trying new things.”
“Doesn’t it make sense to enjoy your college life? To be well-rounded? To pursue new relationships?”
Sarah was exasperated. She wasn’t used to someone challenging her perspective so effectively. “You’ve got my head spinning. It doesn’t help that every time you kiss me, my IQ drops 50 points. How can my plan make so much sense, yet your completely opposite approach makes sense too?”
His next words caught her off guard. &quot;How can a piece of paper be both thin and wide?”
Before she could formulate an answer, Evan leaned in to kiss her again.
The taste of his kiss was sweet and confusing. Pulling back, Evan proposed again. “Thursday night, dinner at seven at the Thai Garden?&quot;
After a moment of hesitance, she relented. &quot;Alright, I will meet you there at seven.”
Evan's joy was infectious as he clapped his hands together. “That’s awesome! Can I get your phone number? Your last name?”
&quot;Let’s wait and see how it goes,&quot; Sarah replied cautiously.
He nodded, accepting her boundaries. As she turned to leave, he extended his hand. “May I walk you to your car?”
They walked hand in hand, and when they reached her car, Evan leaned in, hopeful. “May I get a kiss goodbye?”
“Of course.” She echoed his earlier words, her breath steadier now.
The kiss was long and tender, filled with promises of the potential for something more. Pulling away, Evan teased, “How’s that IQ doing?”
Sarah responded with an unusual attempt at humor. “2+2 equals 10.”
Laughter filled the air, a comforting and intimate sound. When it finally faded, Evan's eyes held a hint of concern. “I’m afraid to let you go. I’m worried you won’t show up on Thursday.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. I never break an appointment unless it’s an emergency.” Sarah's voice was steady, and Evan could see the resolve in her eyes, a promise of the adventure to come.</Text>

            <Title>0116 Evan Hopes for Sarah's Return</Title>
            <Synopsis>Evan stayed put, sitting on the stairs where he had just kissed the woman of his dreams. He hoped that she returned to the scene of the kiss. When she didn't show, he returned to the Quad to tell Guido all about what had just happened.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan stood just outside the entrance of the undergrad library, his heart still pounding from the kiss. He glanced down at the spectacles in his hand, a silent testament to the whirlwind event that had occurred just minutes prior. All thoughts of studying had fled; Sarah was the only subject matter on his mind now.
His feet began to trace the pathway to the Morrow Plots, almost on autopilot, as his mind played out the scenarios of Sarah returning. He visualized her surprise upon seeing him there, remembering their passionate kiss. The fantasy was tantalizing. He did not stray too far, lingering near the sight of their fateful encounter.
Evan paced, his eyes scanning the area for a hint of Sarah. One hour passed, then another. She did not return. Disappointment crept in, but with it came a renewed determination. He would mend her glasses, return to the same spot tomorrow. He hoped fate or Sarah's schedule would be consistent.
With his newfound resolution, Evan sought out his friend Guido, his steps carrying him toward The Quad. As expected, Guido was in the midst of his own adventure, attempting to charm two sophomore coeds. 
Yanking Guido away from his endeavor, Evan said, &quot;I gotta tell you something!&quot; His voice echoed his excitement. 
&quot;Why'd you do that?&quot; Guido protested, his bravado still on display. &quot;I had those two in the palm of my hand.&quot;
Ignoring Guido's typical exaggeration, Evan blurted out, &quot;I just kissed the most beautiful, amazing, wonderful woman in the world!&quot; 
Guido responded with skepticism, a hint of sarcasm edging his words. &quot;Sure you did.&quot;
Undeterred, Evan pressed on, relaying the entirety of his story, brandishing Sarah's glasses like a prized trophy. Guido laughed, his surprise echoing through The Quad. Seeing Sarah's glasses were broken, Guido said, &quot;That must've been one hell of a kiss!&quot;
&quot;It was!&quot; Evan's voice was soft, reverent. &quot;I think I will call her Cinderella. Instead of leaving a glass slipper, she left eyeglasses.&quot;
Guido raised an eyebrow, visibly taken aback.  &quot;You kissed a girl Before even getting her name? That's not like you, bro.&quot;
Evan shrugged, his face lighting up with the memory of the encounter. &quot;The Universe dropped her on my lap, and I had to go for it.&quot;
&quot;And now?&quot; Guido asked, ever the pragmatic.
&quot;I’m going to fix her glasses and try to find her tomorrow. Do you have an eyeglass repair kit?&quot;
Guido's gaze fell on Evan like he'd lost his mind. &quot;Sure, I got one in my back pocket,&quot; he quipped.
&quot;I should be able to find one at the mall. You want to come with?&quot; Evan asked.
&quot;Nah,&quot; Guido glanced across The Quad at a student reading on a blanket in the grass, &quot;I see a lonely lady over there that looks like she needs a visit from 'The Guido.’&quot;
And with that, they parted ways, Evan headed towards his car with a newfound mission and a heart brimming with anticipation. Despite the uncertainty of whether he would find Sarah the next day, he felt an unusual sense of excitement, like he was on the brink of something truly wonderful.</Text>

Scene Name: Guido Hears the Big News
Summary: While heading to work, Evan enthusiastically updates Guido on his successful day with Sarah and asks for suggestions for a special gift for their upcoming first date. Though initially annoyed by the question, Guido's insight ultimately inspires a vision for the perfect gift, marking another step in Evan's pursuit of Sarah.
Characters: Evan, Guido
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Location: Guido's Car - Honda Civic
Tone: Celebratory, Anticipatory
Weather: Not relevant for this scene
Special Instructions: 
In the sequence of events section, I provide some ideas of what might be done and spoke. You have full discretion to write this scene and dialogue the way you feel works best.
Sequence of Events:
The scene begins in Evan's and Guido's apartment. 
They are late for work. Evan needs to be there in time because he has a client session scheduled at 6 o'clock – his schedule start time is personal trainer.
Guido doesn't have anything until seven. He's taking even more time than usual in the bathroom making sure every air is in place. There is a new female personal trainer that we do want to impress.
Evan is anxious because he does will be late for his client session. More importantly, he wants Guido hurry up so he can tell Guido all about his day with Sarah. He knows there's no point in telling Guido when Guido's admiring himself in the mirror.
It's Guido's turn to drive today. On the ride to the gym Evan relives his experience with Sarah.
Guido listens to his friend is best he can, but he is a little concerned how obsessed Evan is with this girl. Guido's never seen obsessed with any girl. 
Evan is begging Guido for ideas on how to make the date special. Guido looks at his family's crazy. 
Guido: “How what I know what special is? Special to me is I spend the night.”
Just starts naming things anyone would think of. Candy, Flowers, A bottle of wine, lingerie
Evan keeps shooting down for one reason or another. Either the gift is cliché and not special enough, or it's not appropriate for first date.
Eventually Guido gets irritated and says, &quot;I don't know dude you're asking the wrong guy. Get your act together dude, or she is going to ditch you 10 minutes into the date. You better play cool like ‘The Guido’”
Evan acknowledges that Guido has somewhat of a point. He is acting hyper enthusiastic. 
Guido said, &quot;Look bro, I'm glad you got a date with this girl. But from what I hear, he's a bit mature for her age.&quot; 
Evan asked what does that that even mean. 
Guido tells him it means she wants a cool sophisticated dude. You better get your act together before Thursday.
Guido continues. Rumor is she is some sort of high-class society girl that wouldn’t give the college the time of day. I hear she only dates older men–
Evan interrupted, that's not true–
Guido interrupts back. It doesn't matter dude. She's clearly not like the girls you I are used to hanging out with. If you want to get her something special, then you gotta realize what special her like a Gucci purse, or expensive shoes, or jewelry –
[[ Guido pulls into the gym ]]
[[Evan interrupts Guido after he says jewelry. ]]
That's it! You're a genius, dude.
[[Words Guido loves to hear]]
Guido asks what are you going to get her?
[[They get out of the car and head to the entrance of the gym]]
Evan says, I don't know. I'll go to the mall tomorrow and look for inspiration. 
[[ scene ends ]]

            <Title>Mary Higgins Clark</Title>
            <Text>In the sprawling campus of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the destinies of two distinct individuals, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, were dramatically intertwined. 
Evan Vaughn was the golden boy of the university, a charismatic senior with an appealing athletic build. Having been reared by his gentle sister Liz, he was known for his humility and respect towards everyone, regardless of their status. His performance in academics was unfortunately mediocre, not in line with his athletic prowess. Despite this, a promise made to his sister propelled him to strive for a 3.0 GPA, exchanging his leisurely times with his friend Guido for long hours in the library.
Sarah Wilkins, on the other hand, was an epitome of academic excellence. She carried the ambition to graduate as a class valedictorian. Libraries were her sanctuaries, where she would lose herself in intricate audio seminars and prepare for her teaching assistant role in a Business-101 class. Slated to take over her father's corporation, she was convinced that any romantic involvements should be put off until after her Master's degree.
Fate intervened when an absent-minded Sarah nearly stumbled down a flight of steps. It was Evan's quick instincts that saved her, their unexpected collision ending in a passionate, unexpected kiss. Sarah's glasses were left behind in the wake of her hasty retreat.
A few days later, Evan sought her out, bringing along her repaired glasses. Despite her initial reluctance, she found herself agreeing to a casual meeting in the food court. Amidst the throngs of people that flocked around Evan, Sarah's insecurities surfaced and she left abruptly. Yet, after another kiss filled with electric intensity, she decided to give their relationship a chance.
To aid in her preparation for the date, Sarah turned to Katie Andrews, a sincere student from her class. Through a fresh makeover, Sarah began to reconsider her earlier decision against dating in college. But if she was going to venture into the tumultuous sea of romance, it would have to be on her terms.
Evan happily agreed to her conditions. They embarked on a thrilling journey, with Sarah gradually discovering her romantic side and Evan improving in his academics under her tutelage. While they reveled in the present, uncertainty lingered over their future, with Sarah's indecisiveness about pursuing further studies at an Ivy League school and Evan planning a secret proposal.
At their graduation party, Evan's unexpected proposal stirred up a whirlwind of emotions in Sarah. Her practicality made her hesitate, but love won over. Yet, the thought of confronting her father, whom she had deceived about her involvement with Evan, haunted her.
Her father then presented a challenge. She could either pursue her Master's degree while accompanying Evan to Chicago or stick to her initial plan. If she chose Evan, she would lose her father's financial support. 
Sarah was torn between two futures. She knew of Evan's commitment to his sister and his promising job opportunity in Chicago, and she didn't want to impede his progress. Now she was faced with a difficult decision: adhere to the path she had meticulously planned or surrender to the whirlwind of love. After a period of deep reflection, Sarah chose Evan, allowing love to triumph over her practical considerations.</Text>

Description: 
A charming little Thai restaurant tucked away in a quieter corner of town. The place was an intimate cocoon, exuding an enchanting blend of modern aesthetic and traditional Thai decor. Warm, golden lighting cast a soft glow over the well-worn wooden tables and chairs, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. 
Ornate, hand-carved wooden panels adorned the walls, depicting scenes of Thai mythology and culture. Splashes of vibrant silk fabrics, used as table runners and curtains, added rich pops of color, complemented by the sweet aroma of exotic spices wafting from the kitchen.
The centerpiece of the establishment was a small wishing well situated near the waiting area. Crafted from aged stone and moss, it was an unexpected touch that lent an air of whimsy to the place. Trickling water cascaded down, producing a soothing melody that added to the tranquil ambiance. A collection of coins glistened at the bottom, tossed by hopeful patrons making silent wishes. It was a charming symbol of the restaurant's welcoming and dreamy atmosphere, offering a unique touch to their dining experience.</Text>

            <Title>0101 Sarah is Late for Class</Title>
            <Synopsis>In the unique setting of an underground library, Sarah Wilkins loses track of time while engrossed in an audio seminar. Realizing she's late for teaching her Business-101 class, she quickly packs her belongings and rushes toward the library's exit, her seminar still playing in her ears. The scene ends as she reaches the stairs, setting the stage for a chain of unforeseen events.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Undergrad Library, with its unique underground design, had been a place of solace for many University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign students. The University had made a deliberate choice to construct the library below ground level, a testament to the respect they held for the adjacent historic Morrow Plots. The Undergrad Library's subterranean architecture ensured that no shadow tainted the historic plots above.
Inside the library, the relentless fluorescent lighting illuminated Sarah Wilkins as she sat engrossed in her audio seminar. International business strategies... There's so much potential here, she thought. The seminar's captivating insights into the expansion of businesses on a global scale played through her earbuds, drowning out the muted hum of student conversations and the distant rustling of pages.
For Sarah, a teacher's assistant in the throes of her academic journey, this library had been a regular haunt. Today, she had settled into one of the study tables, surrounded by her books and notes. As a dedicated TA, Sarah was responsible for guiding the first-year students through the fundamentals of Business-101.
Time seemed to slip away amidst the vast ocean of knowledge. It was only when she glanced at the time displayed on her phone that realization hit her. She was late! The class she taught would start in mere minutes. Panic surged through her veins.
She hastily packed her belongings, making sure not to pause the audio seminar. She wanted to catch every last word, even if it meant multitasking amidst the chaos. As she scooped up her books and notes, she opted to leave her earbuds in, the compelling voice in her ears serving as a comforting presence amidst her mounting anxiety.
She dashed towards the library's staircase, hoping that if she hurried, she could make it to her class on time. The echoing steps of her shoes resonated with her heartbeat, amplifying the sense of urgency. As she ascended, the world outside remained a mystery to her. With her focus on the seminar and her impending class, the last thing on her mind was what lay beyond the library's exit. </Text>

            <Title>0204 The Enforcers Win!</Title>
            <Synopsis>Patti sizes up Sarah during the game while Sarah educates herself on a game she knows nothing about. Evan and Guido's team, the Enforcers, win their game!</Synopsis>
            <Text>Patti settled in to watch the softball game. Her eyes immediately drifted to Sarah, who sat a few rows down, her head buried in a book. She is pretty, Patti admitted to herself. But why a book at a softball game? Why did Evan choose her? The thoughts stung as jealousy welled up within her.
Sarah looked up whenever Evan was up to bat, then returned to her book, Softball for Dummies. Her smile was genuine, her eyes filled with a keen desire to understand the game, to support Evan.
Roxanne, seated beside Patti, had already made up her mind about Sarah. Unable to see the book’s title from her vantage point, her face twisted in irritation, she whispered, “Can you fucking believe she's reading a book at her boyfriend's softball game?” emphasizing the word &quot;boyfriend's&quot; with air quotes.
Patti's lips pressed into a thin line. She wanted to share Roxanne's disdain but couldn't shake off her conflict. The morning air was crisp, but as the game progressed, the sun warmed the field, mirroring the increasing tension in Patti's mind.
Patti stood up. &quot;I'm headed to the concession stand. Can I grab anyone a beer or something to drink?&quot;
Roxanne grumbled her order, and Patti turned to Sarah. Unaware of what a concession stand sells, Sarah asked if they served wine. Pattie replied, “I don’t think they have any wine. Would you like something else instead? My treat!”
Sarah looked up, appreciative. &quot;No, thank you,&quot; she replied, her voice soft.
Roxanne rolled her eyes and mumbled an insult, but Patti shot her a scolding look and silently mouthed, “Knock it off!”
The game was heating up, the score tied, Evan on third base, and Guido up to bat. The energy in the bleachers was palpable, and even Sarah was now fully vested in the game, her book forgotten. She pulled out the pendant Evan had made for her, rubbing it nervously. Patti noticed the unique design, sensing its significance.
Guido swung, connecting with a satisfying crack. The ball soared, and Evan sprinted home, scoring the winning run. The crowd erupted in cheers, Sarah jumping up and down, her face alight with excitement. Patti wanted to join in, but her enthusiasm was dampened, her eyes fixed on Sarah. Roxanne muttered something about Sarah being fake, but Patti barely heard her.
Evan and Guido dashed toward the bleachers, high-fiving teammates on the way. Evan made a beeline for Sarah, picking her up and spinning her around before planting a passionate kiss on her lips. To Patti, it felt like an uppercut to her chin.
Guido invited everyone to &quot;Sluggers,&quot; a sports bar and grille, for a post-game celebration. As Evan and Sarah headed to the car, Patti asked Guido about the pendant. His explanation, the story behind it, felt like a final knockout punch. She had never known Evan to be creative like that. She had never received any sentimental gifts when they were together.
Roxanne's face turned red as she watched Evan and Sarah celebrate the victory. Unable to contain her anger, she turned to Guido, her voice laced with fury. “What the hell is wrong with Evan? He’s so insensitive, making out with his ‘girlfriend’ in front of Patti. It pisses me off!”
Quick to Evan’s defense. Guido, calm but firm, shook his head as he met Roxanne's eyes. “He is not being insensitive. You know Evan. He’s just oblivious to this kind of thing. He doesn’t know he’s hurting anyone. We’re all his friends. He expects us to support his choices.”
“That’s bullshit, Guido!” Roxanne snapped, her arms crossed defiantly.
Silently observing the exchange, Patti finally spoke up, her voice softer but resolute. “It’s not bullshit. Technically, he and I were never a couple– just friends having fun. If I brought a boyfriend to the game, Evan would support me, no matter what he may or may not feel inside. ” Her eyes met Guido's, a question in her gaze. “He’s in love with her, isn’t he?”
Guido held out his hands, palms facing upward, and his shoulders lifted in a careful, deliberate shrug. His expression was thoughtful, his eyes momentarily distant, as if he himself were searching for the answer to Patti's question. He didn't answer her question. He didn't need to. His shrug said it all.</Text>

Draft Scene:
As they entered the upscale, modern apartment, Sarah and Katie naturally diverged. For Katie, unaccustomed to such luxury, the entire space was a marvel. She was entranced, her gaze traveling over the tastefully minimalist decor, pristine cleanliness, and the blend of modern furniture. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view of an untouched nature preserve in central Illinois—an unexpected gem, offering a green oasis laced with a shimmering creek.
&quot;Wow, Sarah, your place is amazing!&quot; Katie marveled, her voice slightly echoing in the vast space. She found herself gravitating toward the panoramic view, her footfalls soft against the gleaming hardwood floor.
In response, Sarah, already heading toward the kitchen, dismissively gestured with her hand. &quot;It's just home,&quot; she called back. &quot;Make yourself comfortable, Katie. Want something to drink? Coffee? Water? Or maybe a glass of wine?&quot;
Katie, still mesmerized by the vast preserve, turned at Sarah's words. &quot;Oh, I'd love some wine, but still a few years away,&quot; she said with a smirk. &quot;Better make it water.&quot;
Sarah let out a chuckle, &quot;Oh, I didn't even think about that,&quot; she admitted, her tone light and amused.
Katie said, &quot;You must be rich!&quot;
&quot;I'm not, but my father is. He owns a large corporation and pays the bills.&quot; Sarah explained as she finished pouring the drinks. She  gestured to the plush seating area that faced the scenic outdoors. &quot;Have a seat on the couch.&quot; 
Katie's youthful energy was infectious, her eyes wide with awe and excitement. &quot;Oh, my God! I love this place!&quot; Her voice rang out with pure delight, echoing around the room before she took an arm's open, playful back plunge onto the couch, her body sinking comfortably into its plush cushions. Her laughter filled the room, a joyful melody wrapped around them like a comforting blanket.
Holding a glass of chilled wine in one hand and a glass of water in the other, Sarah watched with a smile playing on her lips. She was amused by Katie's genuine delight, the vibrancy in the younger woman's eyes reflecting a life very different from her own. 
Sarah gracefully handed Katie the glass of water, then nestled into the other end of the couch, curling her legs underneath her. She held her glass of wine comfortably as she faced Katie, their eyes meeting in a silent agreement to embark on a girlish chat.

Sequence of Events:
The students of Sarah’s Business 101 course were busy taking their exams. Sarah placed a folded note on the desk of one of her brightest students, Katie Andrews. The message read, Can you meet me after class?
Katie Andrews is bubbly. She had pink highlights in her hair and always had a smile on her face. She was always quick to make a friend. At the end of class, Katie waited for all the other students to leave and then walked up to Sarah’s desk ex.
“Hi, Ms. Wilkins. What’s up?” Katie asked.
“Thank you for meeting with me. I’ve always admired your style, even though it’s different from my own. I have a first date tonight and want to look appropriate for the evening. I haven’t been on a date in a while, and I’m unsure what to wear.”
“I’d love to help!” said an excited Katie. “Are we talking wardrobe only or full makeover?”
Sarah pondered for a moment. “Whatever you think is best.”
“Really! Oh my gosh, Ms. Wilkins, I would love to do a full makeover! The other girls are going to be so jealous.”
“Why?” Sarah asked.
“In this class, it’s every girl’s fantasy to do a makeover on you, and it’s every boy’s fantasy that by day you are a stuffy, uptight teacher, but at night you’re a sexy vixen.” Katie let out a quick laugh and then said, “Oh no, I hope that didn’t sound offensive.”
Sarah laughed, “I’m not offended; I understand.”
“What time is your date?”
“It’s at 7 PM at the Thai Garden Restaurant.”
“I heard that place has great food! Do you live off-campus?”
“Yes, I have an apartment about 10 minutes away.”
“I don’t have a car. Can you pick me up by the freshman dorms in about an hour?”
“I’ll be there,” confirmed Sarah as she gave Katie a business card with her cell phone number on it.
“Great! I can’t wait.” Katie said enthusiastically and then gave Sarah a big hug. “If we are going to be friends, I’d like to call you by your first name. Would that be okay?”
“Of course, my name is Sarah.”

Title: Evan Impresses
Summary:
Sarah readies Evan for her fundraising event, noticing his nervousness but amazed at how effortlessly he fits into her high-class, charitable sphere. Though clearly an outsider, he wins the crowd's favor. Witnessing Evan flourish in her world eradicates her last shred of hesitation, letting her fully commit her heart to him.
Leading Context:
Leading Context:
In the previous scene, Sarah was surprised to see that Evan fit in well at the upscale fundraiser. So well, the founder of the nonprofit organization, Marcus Chamberlain, told Sarah to pull the Chicago Bears football tickets off the auction table because he would give them to Evan to recruit a handful of his friends to volunteer at an upcoming project.
This scene picks up when Sarah is headed to the auction table to grab the tickets before the auction starts.
Setting:
Location: The Grandeur Hotel
Luxury Room at The Grandeur Hotel:
The luxury suite at the Grandeur Hotel was the epitome of elegance and opulence. As the door swung open, the first thing that captured the attention was the breathtaking view of the city skyline, framed perfectly by floor-to-ceiling windows draped in sumptuous silk curtains. The room was bathed in a gentle golden glow from the crystal chandeliers that hung delicately from the high ceilings.
Rich mahogany furniture adorned the space, from the king-sized bed with its plush pillows and satin comforter to the sophisticated writing desk nestled near the window. Every piece was intricately carved and polished to a shine, reflecting the meticulous attention to detail that defined the room's aesthetics.
To one side of the suite lay a living area, furnished with plush velvet sofas and a glass coffee table holding the latest magazines and art books. Abstract paintings adorned the walls, adding a contemporary flair to the otherwise classic ambiance.
A grand mirror hung above a polished marble fireplace, its crackling flames casting a cozy warmth throughout the space. Adjacent to the fireplace, a mini-bar was stocked with a selection of fine wines and spirits, glinting invitingly under the soft lighting.
The en-suite bathroom was a masterpiece in itself, boasting a large Jacuzzi tub surrounded by veined marble, a walk-in rain shower, and ornate gold fixtures. Fluffy white towels and high-end toiletries were laid out with precision, ready for use.
Elegance and comfort were woven into every aspect of the suite, from the plush carpeting underfoot to the soft music playing subtly in the background. Everything was carefully curated to provide a haven of luxury, a place where guests could truly feel pampered and special. Whether one was in town for business or leisure, this room at the Grandeur Hotel promised a stay filled with indulgence and sophistication.

Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
Sarah grabbed the Bears tickets from the auction room table. She thought, “Mr. Chamberlain said these were valuable and put them somewhere safe.&quot;
Since Evan seemed to be doing well on his own, she decided to run up to her room and put them in her hotel room safe. 
[ She headed up to her hotel room. ]
[ Place a vivid description of the luxury room using the information provided in this template. ]
[ Describe Sarah opening the safe and putting the tickets in. ]
Sarah had considered booking her and Evan in the same room but didn't feel ready yet. 
[ Through narrative and internal dialogue, express Sarah's thoughts as she wondered if Evan would be upset that they would sleep in separate rooms. ]
Middle:
Sarah headed back down to the bar, where bartender Jenni poured Sarah her favorite wine without needing to be asked.
[ Jenni commented on how well Evan was adjusting to this new environment. ]
Jenni: “Your boy is doing pretty well out there.&quot;
 Sarah expressed her surprise at how quickly Evan bonded with Marcus Chamberlain. She told Jenni, at first, she was horrified that Evan wasn't talking to such a distinguished man more eminently. But next thing she knew, they were talking about football and quarterbacks and acting like they had been buddies for years. 
Jenni: &quot;Boys will be boys.&quot; 
[ The square dancing comment is meant to produce a humorous visual for the reader. ]
 Sarah watched as Marcus introduced Evan around the room. Not just to male sports fans but all attendees of the fundraiser. Evan was going from group to group and couple to couple, shaking hands so often that it looked like he was at a square dancing competition.  
[ Evan was thriving. ]
[ Sarah mumbled to herself. ]
Sarah: &quot;I just don't get it!&quot; 
Jenni: “What do you mean?” 
Sarah: &quot;Never mind, I was talking to myself.&quot;
[ Jenni sensed that while Sarah wanted to share more, Sarah had a strict rule to never discuss the details of her personal life with those that she worked with. Her father had always told Sarah to treat the people you work with well but never become their friend – it's not good business. ]
Jenni told Sarah that she was aware that Sarah liked to keep her business life and professional life separate, but since bartenders are notoriously good listeners, Sarah should feel free to share her personal feelings. 
[ Sarah Opened up. ]
Sarah explained that in the month she and Evan had been dating, she'd been to several softball games and a couple of small parties with Evan's friends, which always felt awkward. To Sarah, it was almost like they were speaking another language. Sarah said they play drinking games at the parties and gossip about who's sleeping with who and who did what to whom. She knew she would never form close bonds with Evan's friends.
She told Jenni she didn't understand how Evan could walk up to the most important man in the room, and instead of speaking to him in the professional manner that everyone spoke to him, Evan talked to Marcus like he was a college buddy and next thing you know Marcus offered Evan NFL football tickets. 
Jenni suggested to Sarah maybe that was the point. Marcus was probably tired of everybody treating him with kid gloves. Marcus probably found Evan’s approach to him refreshing. Jenni then pointed to Evan as he mingled amongst many different people. 
Jenni: “Look, I think they all do.” 
[ “All do,” meaning they all find Evan's approach refreshing. ]
[ Sarah was quiet for a second – deep in thought. ]
Sarah: “I don't think I can hold back anymore. I'm not sure I want to.”
Jenni: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
Sarah: “Evan's been all in since the day we met. But I still struggle with the fact that we live in such different worlds. I'll never fit into his, and while he's doing well tonight, in the long run, I don't think this is the world that suits him best. “
 Jenni:  “I'm not quite following your thinking.”
Sarah:  “I think of falling in love. And even since  this relationship can only last until the end of the school year, what is the point of fighting it anymore? What am I afraid of? I think Evan has melted my protective ice castle to the ground. Do you know how I am feeling about it right now, watching how easily he blends in, watching the smile on his face and others’ faces as he thrives in this unchartered territory for him?”
[ Jenni tried to guess. ]
Jenni: &quot;Impressed, inspired, dazzled?&quot;
[ Sarah laughed. ]
Sarah: “Yes, all those things! But more than anything, it turns me on.“
[ Surprised by Sarah's Revealing comment but finding it funny, Jenni laughed. ]
Jenni: &quot;Are you gonna do something about that?&quot;
Sarah: &quot;I wish.&quot;
[ Sarah looked at her watch. ] 
Sarah: &quot;Dinner starts at about 10 minutes.&quot;
[Jenni noticed that Sarah was in deep thought. ]
Jenni: &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;
[ This is meant as a humorous line to end the middle portion of this scene. Sarah was thinking about the last thing she heard Marcus and Evan discussing and wondered out loud. ]
Sarah: &quot;What is a quarterback?&quot;
[ Although Sarah didn't mean it as a joke, the thought that this brilliant woman didn’t even know what a quarterback was, caused Jenni to break out laughing. In a fun way, not in a judgmental way. ]
End: 
 Evan noticed Sarah at the bar. He made a final handshake with the couple he was speaking to. The man gave Evan a business card before Evan headed over to see Sarah. 
[ He showed Sarah the business card. Evan was excited.  ]
Evan: &quot;This guy owns a big tech company in Chicago. He told me to give him a call after I graduate!&quot; 
[ While usually, Sarah would see this as big news, she had other things on her mind. She insisted Evan follow her. ]
[ Confused, Evan asked her where they were going, ]
[ It is meant to produce a humorous visual to the reader as Sarah yanked the unexpected Evan to take him to the storage room they were before. In a previous scene, Evan had jokingly asked if that was the &quot;make-out room.&quot; At that time, Sarah was paranoid and did not consider it a make-out room. But now feeling turned on by the events of the evening, she called it the make-out room. Hopefully this will give the reader a light and funny feeling as they head to the storage/make-out room. ]
[ Sarah grabbed Evan's hand authoritatively and yanked Evan causing him to lose balance slightly. She answered his question. ]
Sarah: &quot;The make-out room.&quot;
[ Evan didn't say anything, but his expression showed excitement that apparently Sarah had overcome her paranoia about kissing in the storage room. ]
[ This next dialogue line is meant to be light and fun. When they get into the storage room, Sarah shuts the door and pushes Evan up against the door.] 
Sarah: &quot;We only got five minutes, let's make it count!&quot;
[ Sarah leaned in and kissed Evan with great intensity and passion. To complete this scene, Provide a vivid description of the kiss. The scene should end on a note of passion. ]
Objectives/Goals:
This scene hits on many points:
Sarah's excepts she and Evan live in different worlds, and in the long run, that could never work.
Sarah decided regardless of what the future holds, for now and until the end of the school year she's she's almost ready to go all in, as Evan already has.
She was beginning to finally admit that she was falling in love with Evan.
The underlying subtext for the story, is that the reader should see that regardless of her feelings for Evan, Sarah is still seeing this as a senior year of fun, with no future beyond. Perceiving the relationship as short-term is the only way she could fully let go and embrace a relationship with Evan.
Props/Items:
Bears tickets
Glass of wine

Title: Evan Professes His Love
Summary:
After a fundraiser, Evan escorts Sarah to her room and professes his love. Though in love with Evan, Sarah isn’t ready to tell him. Evan respects her feelings, earning admiration by not pressuring her for more, and leaves for his hotel room after a sensual kiss. Both are left contemplating their emotions, secure in their growing connection.
Leading Context:
The previous scene ended with Sarah and Evan’s passionate embrace in the storage room, affectionately nicknamed “The Make-out Room.” Their quick rendezvous soon gave way to the joyful responsibilities of the night, as they returned to the fundraiser, both exhilarated and thrilled by their shared experience.
The evening unfolded wonderfully, exceeding even the most optimistic expectations of both Sarah and Evan. Together they danced, laughed, and worked the room. Sarah’s charm and determination played a vital role in the event’s success, leading to a remarkable 10% increase in donations over the previous year.
His affection for her grew deeper as Evan watched Sarah excel, commanding the room with grace and determination. The connection between them had always been strong, but the evening’s events had solidified something profound within him. Doubts had been a foreign concept from the start, and now, if there had been any lingering uncertainties, they were washed away entirely. Evan was in love with Sarah, and there was no turning back.
The scene picks up with the two of them, content and fulfilled, waiting for the elevator to take them to their rooms.
Setting:
Location: Hotel Grandeur
Time: After a successful fundraising event.
Weather/Environment: N/A
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Evan, Sarah
Secondary Characters: None
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)
Dialogue Focus: Moderate
Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate
Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
[ Use the leading context to begin the scene with a narrative summary of the successful event. ]
[ While waiting for the elevator, and while in the elevator, write lines of dialogue where Evan and Sarah express how pleased and impressed they were with each other’s performance during the fundraiser. They should be gushing over each other. ]
When the elevator opened, Evan walked Sarah to her hotel room door, where their kisses were slow, soft, and sensual.
Middle:
Sarah: “I hope you aren’t upset that I booked us in separate rooms. I’m not sure that I’m ready.”
[ Evan was not upset at all. He was even excited about having a room to himself in such a fancy hotel. Evan had never stayed in a luxury hotel before. ]
Evan: “Upset? A free room all to myself in a five-star luxury hotel? Why would I be upset?”
Sarah: “I know I’m moving kind of slow compared to other college girls my age.”
[ Evan interrupted before she could continue.]
Evan: “I’m not bothered by the speed of our relationship at all.”
[ He looked Sarah deep in the eyes and spoke sincerely and soothingly. ]
Evan: “It’s so easy to get sex these days. But having what we have is special. It’s something that can’t be manufactured or forced. It just is.”
Sarah: “What is it you find special about us?”
[ Evan takes a few minutes to answer. His gaze penetrated her more profoundly than ever before.]
Evan: “Sarah Wilkins, I’m in love with you. And I’ll wait for eternity to make love if that’s how much time you need.”
[ Evan leaned in and kissed her soft and sensually. ]
[ Sarah had never had anyone tell her they loved her in this way. Her body shivered from head to toe. She wanted to reciprocate Evan’s words of love, but she couldn’t get the words out. ]
Sarah: “Evan, I’m afraid –”
[Evan interrupted her. Putting his index finger gently over lips. ]
Evan: “Shh. You don’t need to say anything before you’re ready. I will cherish the moment you tell me you love me, but I only want to hear it when all fear and doubts are gone.”
End: 
[ Evan leaned in and gave Sarah a final sensual kiss that caused her body to tremble in the light even more. Her body had never stopped quivering since he told her that he loved her. ]
[ Without saying anything more, Evan headed to his room. ]
[ End this scene with a deep dive into Sarah’s thoughts, including some internal dialogue. We want to know how amazing Sarah felt when Evan told her he loved her. How unexpected her feelings were. She never could’ve imagined how good hearing those words felt. ]
Objectives/Goals:
The purpose of this scene is to confirm what the readers have suspected up to this point that Evan is in love with Sarah.
The scene also shows that there is still some resistance from Sarah – although by the end of this chapter, Sarah will finally admit to herself and Evan that she loves him.
Another point of this scene is to show that Evan is very patient about their intimacy and receiving reciprocation of his verbal expression of love. His patience is exactly what Sarah needs to finally be ready to make love with Evan and tell him that she loves him.
Props/Items:
Elevator

            <Notes>Evan Can’t dance

When the fundraiser was over, Evan and Sarah walked hand-in-hand toward the hotel elevators, both exhilarated and thrilled by their shared experience. 
The evening unfolded wonderfully, exceeding even the most optimistic expectations. Together they ate, laughed, and worked the room. Sarah’s charm and determination played a vital role in the event’s success, leading to a remarkable 10% increase in donations over the previous year.
Throughout the evening, Evan’s affection for Sarah grew deeper as he watched Sarah excel, commanding the room with grace and determination. Sarah was a different person in her world. If there had been any lingering doubts, they were washed away entirely. Evan was in love with Sarah, and there was no turning back.

            <Title>0137 Evan Has a Special Gift Made</Title>
            <Synopsis>While at the mall, seeking a special gift for his date with Sarah happens upon a unique gift idea that will memorialize their first meeting.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Evan's heart raced as he wandered through the maze-like corridors of the local mall, peering into one jewelry store after another. The reflection of glimmering gold and sparkling diamonds beckoned him from every window, but nothing seemed right. He wanted something unique, something special, something that would embody his feelings for Sarah.
After hours of searching without luck, frustration gnawing at him, Evan stumbled upon a small privately-owned jewelry store tucked away in a hidden corner. His eyes were immediately drawn to a display case filled with delicate glass slippers, each one only a few inches long. They were interesting and unlike anything he'd ever seen.
A surge of inspiration washed over him. He always called Sarah &quot;Cinderella.&quot; Was this a sign? Evan's steps quickened as he entered the store, captivated by the possibility.
The jewelry store owner, a gentle-looking older man, greeted Evan and explained the significance of the glass slippers. They were merely ornamental, but Evan's mind was already racing. He imagined a necklace, something symbolic, something that would connect to the way Sarah had left her glasses behind.
Evan's eyes scanned the necklaces on display, an idea forming. What if he could find a necklace with tiny little glasses as the charm? That would be perfect, unique, and meaningful.
The owner, noticing Evan's interest, offered assistance, but the store had nothing like what Evan envisioned. Undeterred, Evan thanked the man and continued his search, scouring every store in the mall with growing desperation and disappointment.
Just when he was about to give up, Evan spotted something extraordinary in the window of a vintage toy store—an old-fashioned doll wearing tiny little glasses. Excitement bubbled up within him, and he sprinted to the store, purchasing the doll without hesitation.
With renewed vigor, he returned to the small jewelry store, breathless and grinning, explaining his idea to the owner. He wanted to attach the doll's glasses to a silver necklace, a custom piece unlike anything else. 
&quot;I found something that might work! Can you help me attach these glasses to a silver necklace?&quot; Evan asked, his voice trembling with excitement.
The owner examined the glasses, then looked at Evan. &quot;I can do it, but it won't last long. It might break in the first week.&quot;
Evan's face fell, but the owner quickly continued, &quot;However, we could coat them in sterling silver and attach small eyehooks. That would make it last.&quot;
Evan's eyes lit up. &quot;Can you have it done by Thursday morning?&quot;
The owner smiled, touched by Evan's passion. &quot;Normally, I require two weeks for custom work, but for young love... Come back tomorrow, half an hour before closing. It'll be ready.&quot;
Evan's anxiety about the cost vanished when the owner quoted a price well within his budget. The relief and joy were palpable as he left the store, clutching the receipt in his hand.
Evan practically floated out of the mall, his heart light and his mind filled with anticipation. He had found the perfect gift, something special, something uniquely theirs. He knew, deep in his soul, that Sarah would be pleasantly surprised, and he couldn't wait to see the look in her eyes.</Text>
            <Notes>At first, Evan is anxious to find something special for Sarah. Then he sees a glass slipper at a jewelry store that inspires an idea - he's excited.

            <Synopsis>A steamy make-out session commences after an effective tutoring session and a delicious dinner. Amid the rising heat intensifying kisses and wandering hands, Evan stops himself midstream. He wants to wait until the moment feels right and Sarah is ready before they take their intimacy to the next level. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah ordered the pizza, her eyes gleaming with anticipation. She grabbed Evan’s hand and took him on a tour of her apartment. Everything seemed perfect, even the sudden flashes of lightning outside, adding drama to their evening.
Evan noticed some freshman textbooks in the guest room and asked about them. “My friend Katie uses this room as a study sanctuary,” she replied.
Evan’s eyes sparkled mischievously as they entered her bedroom, and he flirted, “This is already my favorite room.”
With mischief in her eyes, Sarah smiled and said, “I bet it is.” She continued the tour, ending with the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room. Together, they looked out at the lightning dancing in the sky.
Evan confessed his love for watching movies on stormy nights. Sarah, surprisingly, told him she rarely watched movies or TV.
“That’s awesome!” Evan exclaimed. “I get to share all my favorite movies with you.” His enthusiasm seemed genuine, but something in his eyes held back, a secret hesitance he was not yet willing to share.
Soon, they were cuddled on the sofa, a blanket shared between them. Evan downloaded his streaming app, scrolling for a movie. The sound of the doorbell broke their comfortable silence.
&quot;That must be the pizza,&quot; Sarah said, hopping up. She opened the door to find the soaking-wet delivery man holding their dinner.
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, tipping him extra for braving the storm.
Back on the couch, with pizza and refreshments, they settled in. As Sarah bit into her pizza, the deep, rich flavors surprised her. This is better than I thought, she mused.
They continued watching, the thunder growing louder. Suddenly, a huge clap of thunder startled them. Sarah’s heart pounded, but not only from the storm. She realized how wonderful it felt just cuddling with Evan. She told him, giggling, and he smiled though his eyes seemed to say more.
Later, a deafening thunderclap shook the house, causing the power to go out. They laughed, using their phones as flashlights, lighting candles.
Back on the couch, the storm moving on, Evan looked into Sarah’s eyes. They kissed, slow at first, then more passionately. Sarah felt Evan’s hands wander, a desire building in her.
Yet, Evan’s touch was different, a push-and-pull that hinted at a battle within him. His kisses were intense, yet his hold was gentle as if he was restraining something.
Then, abruptly, Evan stopped. He stood up, walked to the kitchen, splashing water on his face.
Sarah, confused, followed. “Are you okay?” she asked, fearing she’d done something wrong.
Evan looked deeply into her eyes, his face serious. “I want to do this right,” he said. “Even if it means waiting to make love to you. I don’t want to rush.”
Sarah agreed though a part of her felt a strange relief, as if she’d known this was coming. They discussed when it would be right, though Evan had no clear answer. He said, “I suppose we will know when we will know.”
When the lights popped back on, Evan said he must go. They shared a slow, sensual kiss at the door, promising more but waiting for the right moment.

</Text>
            <Notes>Evan and Sarah's lips met hesitantly at first, a gentle brush that was tentative and exploratory. As their mouths opened, their kisses deepened, each one more profound than the last, allowing the slow burn of passion to build. Their hands found each other, fingers entwining, while their bodies pressed closer. Time seemed to stretch and twist as the kisses grew more intense and hungry. The world around them faded, leaving only the growing desire that swirled and crackled between them, binding them in a moment that felt both infinite and all too brief. The hesitant start had blossomed into a storm of emotion, a connection that spoke of promises and a future yet to be explored.

Let's have the power go out whether watching a movie. That's when the makeup session begins.

Scene Name: Wardrobe Check
Summary: Katie explores Sarah's wardrobe for a suitable date outfit, urging her to abandon her typical librarian look. They settle on jeans, a T-shirt, and a ponytail, creating a more relaxed and fun appearance for their girls' day out, a departure from Sarah's usual style.
Characters: Sarah, Katie
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Sarah’s Apartment
Tone: Exciting, hopeful, anticipatory, friendly
Weather: Partly cloudy and nice outside.
Special Instructions:

Draft Scene:
The anticipation in Sarah’s apartment was palpable. Cloud-filtered sunlight spilled through the windows, casting an encouraging glow on the room. With a swing of her arm, Sarah revealed the contents of her bedroom closet to Katie. It was an organized array, divided into clear categories: business attire, formal dresses, and a rather underpopulated section of casual clothes.
Katie's eyes widened at the sight of the designer dresses hanging with an air of elegance. &quot;Are these designer?&quot; she gasped.
Sarah's smile shone as bright as the affirmation she gave. &quot;Yes, they are.&quot;
Katie ran her fingers over the silky fabric of a deep-red gown. &quot;They're breathtaking. Do you wear these often?&quot;
Sarah tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and nodded. &quot;I do. My father sees value in contributing to the community, and it doubles as an effective networking strategy. Plus, it spruces up the resume. I manage events for several local nonprofits. I'm practically at a fundraiser or a business social every week.&quot;
Katie's eyebrows arched upwards, intrigued. &quot;I had no idea you led such an interesting life. However, for tonight, these dresses are overkill. We'll need to raid the mall for that perfect outfit. And, trust me, we're not going shopping with you looking like you're heading to a board meeting.&quot; She tossed a pair of jeans and a top at Sarah, her laughter echoing through the room.
&quot;You do have contacts, right?&quot; Katie asked as Sarah caught the clothes.
Sarah nodded in affirmation. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
&quot;Fantastic! Time to go! Change your clothes, put your contacts in, and let's swap that bun for a ponytail.&quot; Katie paused, her energy momentarily reined in. &quot;You have a Facebook account, right? I want to look at your photos. It will give me an idea of how you look in different dresses and colors. We're working against the clock, so the more I know now, the better.&quot;
Sarah, slightly taken aback by Katie's frenzy, acquiesced. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
[[ I want to add mild humor here. Katie might say, &quot;If there's nothing my eyes shouldn't see, can I log in while you get ready?&quot; Sarah might laugh and say something like, &quot;Your eyes are safe&quot; I mostly use Facebook for business contacts, academic stuff, and my nonprofit work&quot;]]]]
Sarah gestured towards her laptop resting on the table. &quot;Sure. It should auto-log you in.&quot;
With Sarah's approval, Katie darted to the dining room. Sarah was left to her transformation, as she replaced her glasses with contacts, her skirt suit with jeans, and a casual top. When she finally stepped out, her hair swishing in a loose ponytail, she was a whole new person.
Katie, absorbed in Sarah's Facebook profile, glanced up and gasped. &quot;Sarah! What a transformation. You look hot!&quot; 
Flattered, Sarah blushed, thanking Katie softly. Her confidence bloomed under the unexpected praise. 
&quot;But we're just getting started, Sarah. We are going to make you look hotter than hot! Evan won't know what hit him.&quot; Katie's words sparked an impish grin on Sarah's face.
[[Have Sarah say something like, &quot;That works for me. Let's get this party started. Consider letting the reader know this is far from Sarah's normal behavior. She is embracing the moment, just as she had when she first kissed Evan. ]]
The anticipation of their shopping spree makeover hung in the air, wrapping around them like an electric current, stirring broad, excited smiles onto their faces.

Katie Andrews is a striking figure in the freshman class of the Business department at the University of Illinois.

With a height of 5’4” and a slightly fuller frame, she exudes a sense of self-assuredness that comes from acceptance of her body, which carries a few extra pounds but is in no way heavy.
Her defining feature isn't physical, though. It's her personality. As a perfect representation of an ENFP Myers-Briggs type, she's warm, friendly, and helpful, always ready to lend a hand or a listening ear. Coupled with this is a bubbly personality that makes her approachable and instantly likeable. These traits align seamlessly with the Caregiver archetype, a role she embraces without hesitation.

What is the character's role in the novel? 
Sarah was aware of the graduation party, but she was oblivious to the plaque that Guido and Evan had arranged for her, and more importantly, she had no clue about Evan's impending proposal. The final surprise was that Evan had invited her parents. They were kept in the dark about the proposal but were informed about the plaque presentation and asked to keep their visit a secret from Sarah. Evan's primary reason for their presence was for them to witness the proposal, a fact he kept hidden.
What Evan did not know was that Sarah had been less than honest with her parents about her relationship with him. She had mentioned Evan to them but had understated the depth of her feelings for him, and his for her. In her father's mind, Evan was merely a social companion for Sarah, and he believed that after Sarah went to an Ivy League school, they would naturally drift apart. She gave the impression that her relationship with Evan was casual.
From the back of the party room, Sarah's parents watched the unexpected proposal unfold. Caught off guard, Sarah accepted Evan's proposal in the presence of all their friends. Her father's disappointment was evident in his expression as he exited the room. Despite having to put on a happy facade as the newly-engaged woman for the rest of the party, Sarah could not shake the image of her father's disapproval and the impending confrontation.
At the conclusion of the festivities, Sarah headed to her parents' hotel room, dreading the upcoming meeting. She could manage anger, but her father's evident disappointment was a far more challenging hurdle. Nevertheless, Sarah stood firm in her decision to marry Evan. Although her mind usually guided her decisions, this time, her heart was in control.
In their meeting, her father did not display anger. Instead, he proposed a deal: he would continue to support her financially for one more month, allowing her time to make the 'right' decision, which in his eyes involved obtaining a Master's degree from a reputable Ivy League or business school and then returning to work for him in Seattle.
Her parents agreed that Evan seemed like a nice young man, but they did not believe he was the right match for Sarah. They stated that they would bless the marriage only if she achieved her Master's degree and returned to Seattle; Evan was welcome to accompany her. However, if Sarah deviated from this plan, her father would terminate his financial support.
Though some emotion escaped Sarah, the conversation remained civil. Sarah found her father's offer fair but also knew that Evan had already secured a job in Chicago and that he wanted to stay close to his sister. 
While she respected her father's stance, he, in turn, respected her decision, even though he disagreed with it. He, however, refused to provide financial support. Yet, he didn't sever ties with Sarah. They continued to stay in contact, and a few years later, when she and Evan were ready to start a business, he loaned them the startup capital. After all, he still loved his daughter.
The business proved to be a success, allowing Sarah to promptly repay the loan with interest.
Notes:
Born on a farm to farmer parents in central Illinois.
His father was a no-nonsense man, and so was Jack.
He met his wife, Mildred, in high school and married her after college.
He had minimal time to enjoy free time in his childhood preteen years. He needed to help his family by attending to duties on the farm.
He got a paying job when he was old enough and started saving for college. 
Jack believed that hard work would win the day. It was difficult for him to watch his father work his hand to the bone to make ends meet while other kids in school had lazy, overweight fathers with white-collar jobs who made triple as much.
Jack didn't want to be a struggling farmer, nor did he want to be a lazy white-collar worker. He wanted the best of both worlds. He intended to earn his wealth, embodying a farmer’s work ethic and the determination of a money-minded entrepreneur. He knew college was vital.
He went to the University of Illinois because he could remain living at home as it was nearby.
He scraped by getting loans and working long hours to pay for tuition.
He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business. 
Tired of working for others, with the support of his wife, Jack started his own business at just 25 years of age.
He experienced significant growth year after year – eventually watching his company grow into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.
He would never admit it, but he really wanted a son. He was secretly disappointed when his only child was to be a girl, Sarah.
Soon enough, he embraced his daughter. She showed signs of brilliance from an extremely early age. She accomplished all her childhood milestones well ahead of time. He decided to mentor Sarah as he would have a son.
Shortly after speaking her first words, he began to prepare her to run the company in his place one day.
This work for Sarah. She never felt cheated that she didn't have many friends or spent more time reading books than playing outside. 
Occasionally, she would want to join in on the fun, and she tried. Her parents never forced anything on her that she didn't like. If She asked for a play date or trip to the park, they accommodated her.
Even to the point where, at 16, Sarah went to her mom and dad and said she wanted to see what it was like to have a boyfriend. Instead of being upset, her father took her to the store and bought condoms. He told her that if she was going to explore her sexuality, he wanted her to be safe. It was in an emotional bond of any kind. It was just responsible, rational thinking.
It wasn't that he didn't love Sarah. He did, and Sarah loved him back. He lived a tough life and wanted Sarah to be tough, so love was never expressed through affection. Even when hugs were exchanged, it always looked and felt a little awkward.
In narrative format, provide details about this character::
Jack Wilkins is a tall, slender man in his mid-60s, with blue eyes and gray hair, resembling actor James Cromwell. He carries the no-nonsense demeanor instilled in him by his farmer father, a man who worked tirelessly to make ends meet. Born and raised on a farm in central Illinois, Jack was no stranger to hard work from a young age. He recognized early on that he did not want to follow in his father's footsteps, nor did he want to lead the life of what he saw as a complacent white-collar worker. 
For Jack, the path to prosperity laid in hard work and education. He maintained a job throughout his teenage years, saving money for college, all while continuing to contribute to the farm work. After high school, he attended the nearby University of Illinois, managing to cover his tuition through loans and working long hours.
After earning his bachelor's degree in business, Jack was ready to break free from working under others. At just 25, with the support of his high school sweetheart and now wife, Mildred, Jack embarked on his entrepreneurial journey. His determination and strong work ethic paid off as his business venture steadily grew, eventually turning into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.
Fatherhood came with its disappointments and joys for Jack. His initial disappointment of having a daughter was swiftly replaced by pride when his daughter, Sarah, demonstrated early signs of brilliance. Jack nurtured Sarah's intellect and ambition, preparing her to eventually take over the family business. His approach to parenting mirrored his overall disposition in life, rational, pragmatic, and perhaps a bit distant.
Jack's deep love for his daughter might not be easily discernible through his actions, but it has always been there. He desired Sarah to be tough and prepared for the world. The occasional awkwardness during their rare affectionate moments hinted at a man who struggled with expressing his emotions but never questioned the depth of his feelings. Jack Wilkins is not a man of many words, but his actions speak volumes about his character - a hard-working, pragmatic, and loving father who prepared his daughter for a world he knew was not always kind.</Text>

            <Title>0145 Wardrobe Check</Title>
            <Synopsis>Katie checks out Sarah's existing wardrobe to see if there is anything that she can wear on her date. Katie has Sarah swap her library and look for jeans, a T-shirt, and a ponytail – a more fun look for their girl's day out.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The anticipation in Sarah’s apartment was palpable. Cloud-filtered sunlight spilled through the windows, casting an encouraging glow on the room. With a swing of her arm, Sarah revealed the contents of her bedroom closet to Katie. It was an organized array, divided into clear categories: business attire, formal dresses, and a rather underpopulated section of casual clothes.
Katie's eyes widened at the sight of the designer dresses hanging with an air of elegance. &quot;Are these designer?&quot; she gasped.
Sarah's smile shone as bright as the affirmation she gave. &quot;Yes, they are.&quot;
Katie ran her fingers over the silky fabric of a deep-red gown. &quot;They're breathtaking. Do you wear these often?&quot;
Sarah tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and nodded. &quot;I do. My father sees value in contributing to the community, and it doubles as an effective networking strategy. It’s fulfilling work. Plus, it spruces up the resume. I manage events for several local nonprofits. I'm practically at a fundraiser or a business social every week.&quot;
Katie's eyebrows arched upwards, intrigued. &quot;I had no idea you led such an interesting life. However, for tonight, these dresses are overkill. We'll need to raid the mall for that perfect outfit. And, trust me, we're not going shopping with you looking like you're heading to a board meeting.&quot; She tossed a pair of jeans and a top at Sarah, her laughter echoing through the room.
&quot;You do have contact lenses, right?&quot; Katie asked as Sarah caught the clothes.
Sarah nodded in affirmation. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
&quot;Fantastic! Time to go! Change your clothes, put your contacts in, and let's swap that bun for a ponytail,&quot; Katie ordered, her voice bubbling with excitement.
&quot;Yes, Sir Sergeant,&quot; Sarah saluted, mock seriousness on her face.
&quot;You said I was in charge,&quot; Katie shot back, pretending to pout.
&quot;That I did,&quot; Sarah replied, and they both burst into laughter, the joyous sound filling the room.
Katie paused, her energy momentarily reined in. &quot;You have a Facebook account, right? I want to look at your photos. It will give me an idea of how you look in different dresses and colors. We're working against the clock, so the more I know now, the better.&quot;
Sarah, slightly taken aback by Katie's frenzy, acquiesced. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
&quot;If there's nothing my eyes shouldn't see, can I log in while you get ready?&quot; Katie asked, her eyes twinkling with mischief.
Sarah laughed. &quot;Your eyes are safe. I mostly use Facebook for business contacts, academic pursuits , and my nonprofit work.&quot;
Sarah gestured towards her laptop resting on the table. &quot;Sure. It should auto-log you in.&quot;
With Sarah's approval, Katie darted to the dining room. Sarah was left to her transformation, as she replaced her glasses with contacts, her skirt suit with jeans, and a casual top. When she finally stepped out, her hair swishing in a loose ponytail, she was a whole new person.
Katie, absorbed in Sarah's Facebook profile, glanced up and gasped. &quot;Sarah! What a transformation. You look hot!&quot;
Flattered, Sarah blushed, thanking Katie softly. Her confidence bloomed under the unexpected praise.
&quot;But we're just getting started, Sarah. We are going to make you look hotter than hot! Evan won't know what hit him.&quot; Katie's words sparked an impish grin on Sarah's face.
&quot;That works for me. Let's get this party started,&quot; Sarah replied, her voice tinged with excitement. It was far from her normal behavior, but she was embracing the moment, just as she had when she first kissed Evan.
The anticipation of their shopping spree makeover hung in the air, wrapping around them like an electric current, stirring broad, excited smiles onto their faces.</Text>

Sarah grinned, a surprising lightness in her tone. &quot;I haven’t dated since I was 16.&quot;
&quot;16? Wowza!&quot; Katie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. But she wasn't done probing, her next question laced with a touch of delicacy. &quot;If you don’t mind me asking, are you a...&quot; She paused, &quot;virgin?&quot;
&quot;No, I’m not a virgin,&quot; Sarah confessed, the hesitation barely noticeable. &quot;I experimented for a short time in high school, but I didn't see what was so great about it.&quot;
Katie leaned in closer, her voice a comforting whisper. &quot;It will be way different when you find the right guy.” 
A mischievous twinkle lit up in Sarah's eyes, an expression that silently echoed, &quot;Maybe!?&quot; This was a different Sarah, one who was open to the possibility of something more, something exciting, something like... Evan.
Seizing the moment, Katie ventured to ask, &quot;Do you think Evan may be the right guy?&quot;

Title: The College Days
Genre: Romance
Plot Summary:
For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, their first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is underway. They've never met, as their social circles don't intersect. Evan, a charismatic, athletic young man, commands popularity not by choice but by virtue of his outgoing personality. Despite his natural allure, he remains grounded thanks to the guidance from his saintly sister, Liz, treating everyone with kindness.
Evan isn't the most diligent student, preferring the outdoors to the confines of classrooms and libraries. However, to uphold a promise to Liz, he's striving for a minimum GPA of 3.0. As he enters his senior year, his grades are teetering on this threshold, and he is compelled to trade Frisbee games for study sessions at the undergrad library.
Contrastingly, Sarah is a stellar student, poised to graduate at the top of her class. As a business major and teaching assistant, she considers the library her sanctuary, often losing herself in riveting audio seminars, like one on international business strategies. One day, engrossed in her seminar, she realizes she's running late for a class she's teaching. In her rush, she neglects her surroundings and dashes towards a flight of stairs without a handrail.
Evan, heading her way, spots the impending accident. He calls out to her, but she doesn't hear him. He dashes to intercept her before she reaches the stairs, catching her just in time. This unexpected encounter leads to a spontaneous, passionate kiss. 
Sarah, brought up with a single-minded focus on academics and preparing to take over her father's business, has little experience with romance. She had sworn off any romantic entanglements until she completed her Master’s degree and embarked on her professional journey. 
In a whirlwind, Sarah leaves without providing Evan her name or contact. Later, Evan manages to track her down, returning a pair of glasses she had left behind and charming her into taking a break at the food court. Despite her initial hesitation, she gives in to Evan’s allure. 
Their encounter at the food court leaves Sarah questioning herself as she witnesses Evan’s popularity, especially among the female students. Feeling out of place, she retreats, but Evan convinces her to agree to a date. Uncertain about dating norms, Sarah enlists the help of one of her top students, Katie, to modernize her look and prep her for the date. 
During their date, Sarah proposes a business-like arrangement with Evan, setting rules and expectations and prioritizing her academics. Evan, who has been smitten since their first encounter, happily agrees. As they continue to see each other, Sarah allows herself to experience romance and affection, while Evan becomes a better student with Sarah’s help. 
Their senior year unfolds beautifully. Sarah expands her social circle, and Evan lands a good job in Chicago. As graduation approaches, however, Sarah grapples with her future choices – Ivy League schools for her Master's or staying with Evan. Unbeknownst to her, Evan plans to propose at the graduation party, inviting her parents for the surprise.
Sarah, who has downplayed the seriousness of their relationship to her parents, is taken aback by Evan’s proposal. She fears disappointing her father by deviating from her initial plan. Following the party, her father presents her with two choices – follow Evan to Chicago and build a life there, or stick to the original plan of pursuing her Master's and eventually joining her father’s business. If she chooses Evan, her father will cut off financial support.
Sarah is torn between her love for Evan and her commitment to her father. Despite the complexities, her heart prevails, and she chooses to build a life with Evan in Chicago. Sarah and Evan elope. 
While all indications are the happy couple is excited and ready to start a life together, all may not be as it seems.
After a quick marriage ceremony, and Sarah and Evan are officially married, Sarah retreats to the lady’s restroom. Stonefaced, she stares at herself in the mirror and asks herself, &quot;Oh my god. What have I done!?&quot;

Because this is the first book in a series, this first book ends in a cliffhanger, not a happy end resolution that is typical of romance novels.

            <Title>Patti Keane</Title>
            <Text>Replace this character’s existing Profile with this one.
Character Profile:
Name: Patti Keane
Gender: Female
Age: 20
Eye Color: Light Blue
Hair Color: Light Brown
Height: 5’8”
Physical description: Patti is considered by others to be one of the prettiest, if not the most prettiest girl in her junior class. She's too modest to consider herself among the most stunning, but most outsiders would label her as gorgeous.
She's tall and long-legged. She has beautiful, kind, light blue eyes and long brown hair. She dresses like any college coed would, but her clothes are always clean, her hair is always well-kept, and her teeth are as white as snow. This girl tends to her appearance, but not in a narcissistic, vain way. She believes in taking care of herself.  , fit as can be, but her body is very feminine.
Education: Patti is a junior at the University of Illinois
Hobbies And interests: 
Her personal training sessions with Evan paid off. She regularly runs 5K's and participates in at least one triathlon in the summer.
Patti loves college life. She loves classes; she loves parties; she loves college friendships; she loves the campus; She loves the college experience as a whole.
One of the things that bonded her with Evan is that she likes the outdoors as much as he does – hiking, biking, and jogging.
He doesn't play team sports but enjoys attending college football games, basketball games, and Evan and Guido's Sunday software games. She is an enthusiastic fan.
Role in story:
Patti plays an essential role in the following novel in the series.
For this novel, her character is predominantly used to bring information about Evan's romantic past. This will help the reader understand how Sarah differs from the women Evan was involved with in the past – Patti being one of them.
At one point, her character challenges Evan on his decision to be with Sarah. Partially driven by her romantic feelings for Evan but even more so moved by her concern that he has made a choice he will one day come to regret. 
Evan is one of her best friends, and she doesn't want to see him get hurt. In Patty's eyes, it is evident that Sarah and Evan are not compatible enough to make a relationship work long-term.
He scolds her for questioning his relationship with Sarah's potential and suggesting that Sarah is not suitable for him. Evan takes that as a direct criticism of Sarah – which he will not tolerate.
Patti backs off as all of Evan's friends who share her perspective. No friendships are lost, but Evan's relationship with Sarah creates some space in his friendships with everyone other than Guido.
Relationships: 
Like Evan has a best friend that appears to be his opposite, Guido, Patti has a best friend that seems to be her opposite, Roxanne.
Patti met sophomore Evan at the gym as a freshman when she inquired about personal trainer lessons. After six months of college partying, the usually fit Patti had put on a few extra college pounds. However, her real motivation for convincing her parents to pay for personal training was her crush on Evan.
Eventually, Patti transitioned from a client to joining Guido and Evan's inner circle of friends. Patti's roommate Roxanne went along for the ride.
Evan only considered Patti a friend. Patti watched over the next couple of years as Evan had a few quasi-girlfriend relationships. Evan was never intimate with more than one girl at a time – his relationships were always monogamous. However, Evan never labeled any of his intimate partners as official &quot;girlfriends.&quot;
Although Evan didn't like to hurt anybody, he eventually faded out of relationships, damaging a heart or two.
Midway through her sophomore year, Evan's junior year, he began to take an interest in her. They began an intimate relationship that was the same as Patti had seen before. 
Although she had seen how Evan had taken a &quot;friends with benefits&quot; approach in college, Patti had convinced herself that would be different with her. She lasted the longest and even met his sister Liz. She was hurt when Evan faded away over the summer when she returned home.
It was hard for her to be angry at Evan because he never claimed to be in a relationship with her, and officially he never broke up with her because there was no official label. They faded silently back into being friends without benefits.
Until Sarah came into the picture, Patti thought that she and Evan had a chance to rekindle their relationship, even if it would only be friends with benefits.
Patti always thought that she was a perfect match for Evan. This wasn't merely the wishful thinking of a girl with a crush; it was the consensus of those who knew Patti and Evan that they would make a great couple. Even Guido thought so, although he would never say anything to Evan.
Narrative: 
Patti is both attractive and athletic, a blend of beauty queen and Ms. Congeniality. She's popular but kind, treating everyone with respect. Her warm and caring personality is complemented by her fun-loving approach to college life. She maintains good grades and enjoys the social aspects of college without being labeled a &quot;party girl.&quot; Her relationship with Evan is complex, filled with unspoken romantic feelings, concern, and a deep friendship. Her connection to Evan's romantic past adds depth and conflict to the main storyline.

            <Title>0160 Sarah &amp; Evan’s First Date</Title>
            <Synopsis>Sarah and Evan meet at an Asian restaurant for their first official date. Sarah suggests that they begin a relationship with certain conditions. Evan happily agrees.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Thai Garden Restaurant was a hidden gem, tucked away in a bustling part of town. As Sarah stood outside, she could see the glow of warm lanterns hanging from the ceiling and intricately carved wooden panels adorning the walls. Tables adorned with colorful silk tablecloths were spaced generously to create a sense of intimacy. Faint strains of traditional Thai music whispered through the air, mingling with the fragrant aroma of spices and herbs. A tasteful fountain at the center of the dining area added a gentle murmur, completing a sensory experience that promised a cozy, romantic atmosphere.
Through the window, she could see Evan texting on his phone, a sight that brought a flurry of emotions to her heart. Terrified, she thought, feeling a sudden incapability to maintain her no-dating rule. But Sarah was never truly out of control; even at this moment, she had a well-thought-out plan.
Her new dress ensemble, chosen with Katie's help, clung to her figure. It was an elegant blend of confidence and allure, something she hoped would strike the right note.
Evan waited anxiously, trying to find someone to text to help pass the time. He felt a presence over his shoulder and looked up, then back to his phone. A second later, he looked back again, his heart leaping as he realized it was Sarah. Seeing her brought a genuine smile to his face. Evan stood up and kissed Sarah, his lips gentle on her cheek.
“I almost didn’t recognize you. Did you do all this for me?” he asked, referring to her makeover.
“I was in the mood to change things up a bit,” Sarah replied, her eyes moving up and to the right, her lips curling into a sly grin.
“Looking for a change, are you? I hope that bodes well for me.” Evan laughed, his eyes twinkling.
“We’ll see,” she said, a hint of mystery in her voice.
“Let’s go eat!” Evan said, leading her to the table.
When they got to the table, Evan pulled out the seat for Sarah, his movements graceful and practiced. “Thank you. You are quite the gentleman,” she said, her voice soft.
“You look great! But you know you didn’t have to change anything for me. You are beautiful now; you’re as beautiful as when I first laid eyes on you,” Evan said, his voice sincere.
Their server appeared as Evan finished his compliment, ready to take their orders. After two classes of  Pinot Noir were ordered and delivered, Evan went with the Spicy Pad Thai, and Sarah settled on the Som Tam.
“I was worried you wouldn’t show up,” Evan said, his eyes searching hers.
“I told you I always keep my appointments,” she replied, catching herself. “Sorry, poor choice of words. Why don’t we start this date off with you telling me a little about yourself?”
Evan arched an eyebrow playfully. &quot;Now, are you looking for my full résumé, complete with professional references, or just a summary of my many academic achievements?&quot;
Sarah's eyes sparkled as she caught the joke. Even though it was a playful jab at her, she found it endearing. His sense of humor put her at ease.
Sarah burst into laughter, shaking her head. &quot;Ha ha, you're so funny! I promise, no more résumé recitations. Let's stick to the topics normally discussed on a first date.&quot;
Evan raised his glass, his eyes sparkling. &quot;Deal,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with genuine enthusiasm. &quot;Let's make this a night to remember.&quot;
Sarah's heart gave a little leap, and a warm, pleasurable sensation spread through her. She was beginning to feel truly comfortable with him, and the night seemed full of promise. With a smile, she reached out and clinked her glass to his, toasting to the sentiment.          
“Well, I’m a pretty simple guy,” Evan began, leaning back in his chair and casting a casual glance around the room. “I work as a personal trainer at the gym down the street. I like to play sports, hike, run, bike, anything that gets me outside. I enjoy hanging out with my friends. Anything else you want to know?”
His words painted a picture of an active and outgoing person who thrived on physical activities and enjoyed the company of others. Sarah's eyes were fixed on Evan, and she was keen to learn more.
“What’s your major? Are you a good student?” she asked, genuinely interested in understanding what motivated him academically.
Evan’s face turned slightly thoughtful. “I’m majoring in software development. I guess I’m a good student when I apply myself. At least, that’s what my sister would say. I promised her I would maintain at least a 3.0 GPA. I'm hovering around that level now.”
Sarah noted the reference to his sister, intrigued by how Evan’s expression softened at the mention of her. “Are you close to your sister?”
Evan leaned back in his chair, his eyes momentarily distant as he considered the question. “Yes, but she’s in Chicago right now, so I don’t see her as often as I’d like. That’s where I’m from. How about you? What’s your story? Where are you from?&quot;
“I grew up in Seattle, no siblings. I’m a business major focusing on international trade, a teacher’s assistant, and I'm in the running for graduating at the top of our class,&quot; Sarah replied, her voice steady and confident.
The conversation flowed naturally, each question opening up new avenues for exploration. Evan's curiosity was piqued, and he asked, “If you don’t mind me asking, I get the impression that you could’ve gone to any university you wanted to. Why would you pick the University of Illinois?”
“My father owns a large corporation. He was a self-made man from modest beginnings. He went to U of I, and our agreement was I would follow in his footsteps and get my Bachelor’s degree here. After graduation, I plan to attend an Ivy League college for my master’s degree.&quot; 
Evan's eyes sparkled with interest as he leaned forward, “That’s very interesting. Do you have a job?”
As Sarah opened her mouth to reply, their food arrived, pausing the conversation. The server placed their plates on the table with a flourish, the aroma of the freshly cooked meals filling the air.
Sarah looked down at her plate, eyes widening. “This food looks and smells delicious!” She picked up her fork and took a bite, her face lighting up with delight. “It even tastes better than it looks. Excellent choice of restaurants!”
Evan grinned, pride in his selection evident. “I don’t get to come here very often, but I love their food,&quot; he said as he ate his meal, savoring the flavors.
Unperturbed by the interruption, Sarah continued their conversation, her voice filled with enthusiasm. “I don’t have a paying job, but I stay busy volunteering as an events coordinator for various nonprofit organizations in the area. During summer breaks, I intern for large corporations to gain experience.”
“I'm quite impressed!” Evan responded, his admiration genuine. “I like the idea of getting involved with non-profit organizations. It just seems like you should allow some time for fun.”
Sarah grinned and reminded Evan, her eyes twinkling, “I’m here with you, aren’t I?”
“Yes, you are! I'm happy about that,” Evan chuckled, raising his glass to toast their enjoyable evening.
They continued to eat, their conversation flowing effortlessly, the connection between them growing stronger with each passing moment. The laughter, the shared stories, and the pleasure in each other's company marked the date as something special, a chance encounter that held the promise of something more.
Sarah ordered a small espresso for dessert, while Evan chose a piece of strawberry cheesecake. The conversation continued with an air of intimacy, though the ambiance of the restaurant faded into the background as they focused on each other.
Sarah glanced down at her cup, then back at Evan. &quot;I was wondering if I could make a proposal?&quot;
Evan raised an eyebrow, a grin playing on his lips. &quot;A proposal already? We just met,&quot; he joked, then leaned forward, his eyes locking onto hers. &quot;Go ahead. I’m all ears.&quot;
Sarah's expression became thoughtful as she formulated her words. &quot;Since I met you, I have been reconsidering my thoughts on relationships. A relationship is a partnership. I wanted to propose that we form a partnership. In business, it is essential to identify all foreseeable issues before signing an agreement.&quot;
Evan's eyes narrowed thoughtfully, his head tilting to one side. “Interesting analogy. Go on, I’m listening.”
With a steadying breath, Sarah continued. “My father taught me it is best to lead with what I have to offer first, and here is what I can provide to this partnership. I can teach you some study techniques to improve your grades with minimal effort. I can already tell you’re going to want me to break out of my shell and socialize with your friends and others in my age group. I can’t promise I'll attend every party or social event, but I'll accompany you as often as possible, and if there is a particular event that is important to you, I’ll try to attend.”
Evan interrupted, putting down his fork. “May I ask a question?” Sarah nodded, and Evan continued, “I play softball every Sunday morning. Will you be able to come to my games?”
“My schedule is usually clear on Sunday mornings. I should be able to make it to many of your games,” Sarah replied, a reassuring smile gracing her lips.
Having Sarah at his games was an important point for Evan, evidenced by the excited look on his face. “Continue with your proposal,” he urged, leaning back in his chair.
“As adults in a romantic relationship, I expect some physical intimacy will be involved. I want to be honest with you here. I'm not a virgin, but I'm also not very experienced. I haven't been on a date since high school. You are quite attractive, and I'm interested in pursuing a physical relationship. I'll need you to be patient as I explore that aspect of myself. I expect you to wait until I'm ready.”
Evan's face softened, and he reached across the table, covering her hand with his, his expression earnest. “I appreciate your honesty, Sarah. Take all the time you need. I want this to be right for both of us.”
Sarah looked at Evan, her expression sincere. “The most important thing to me is that you understand my academic career comes first. That means no pressuring me to go to parties or spend time together until after I’ve attended to my studies. I attend a lot of formal events. Just as I'll attend your social events, I expect the same in return. Keep in mind these aren’t frat parties.”
Evan's eyebrows shot up, and he leaned back in his chair, slightly taken aback. “Is that what you think I am, a frat boy?”
Sarah quickly reached out, touching Evan's hand. “I didn’t mean to imply that. I want to let you know you may have to dress up for some of these events. These events will also be a great way for you to make important business connections. Those connections may help you find a great job after graduation.”
The stern lines on Evan's face relaxed, replaced by curiosity. “Is making connections why you want me to attend these events?”
“No, it’s not just that,” Sarah replied, her voice softening. “I like you. It would honor me to have you by my side at any event. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you since the moment you kissed me. If we let our relationship develop organically, I may never regain my focus.”
Evan's eyes sparkled with emotion, his words carrying a warmth that made Sarah's heart skip a beat. “I feel the same. You’ve been the only thing on my mind for the last week. I can’t focus any better than you can. There’s something about you that is just so different and so special. It’s like, somehow, I already know it will work out. There’s nothing I want more than to call you my girlfriend.”
“That’s my proposal. Do you have a counter-proposal?” Sarah asked, looking expectantly at Evan.
Evan's eyes twinkled, and a broad smile spread across his face. He had no problem with Sarah’s less-than-romantic offer and voiced his approval. “No counter-proposal. I’m in total agreement!”
Sarah laughed, a sound that was light and genuine. “My father said if they accept your first offer, you offered too much.”
“Look at it from my point of view,” Evan retorted, his voice filled with good-natured amusement. “You said you would attend my games, you plan to explore your sexuality with me when you’re ready, you are going to hook me up with potential employers, and you can help me get good grades, which will make my sister happy. What more could I ask for?”
With a confident smile, Sarah put out her hand for a handshake. “So we have a deal?”
Evan's expression turned mischievous. “No way are we sealing this deal with a handshake.”
The implication of his words hung in the air, not so subtly hinting that it was time to leave the restaurant because he wanted to seal the deal with a kiss. A knowing smile danced in Sarah's eyes, and she felt a pleasant thrill at the prospect. The way Evan looked at her was enough to tell her he felt the same way.
He called for the check, paid it, and then stood up, offering his hand to Sarah. As they walked toward the restaurant's exit, their hands entwined, the air between them crackled with anticipation.</Text>

Title: Sarah and Evan Make Love
Summary:
After discovering Sarah's room key and note that a staff member had slipped under his hotel room door, Evan's heart raced with anticipation. He entered her room to find her alluringly awaiting him under the covers, her eyes filled with desire and trust. In this intimate and profound moment, Sarah finally declared her love for him, words that he had longed to hear. Their connection deepened as they made love, not just a physical union but a cementing of their emotional bond, forging a connection that neither of them had ever felt before.
Leading Context:
In the preceding scenes, Sarah entrusted a hotel staff member named Nina with a mysterious task: to slide an envelope under Evan's hotel room door. Obliging Sarah's request, Nina carried out her mission, leaving Evan to discover the envelope's contents. Upon opening it, Evan found a key to Sarah's room, accompanied by a note expressing her readiness to make love to him for the first time. The scene closed with Evan's joyous and excited reaction to this unexpected but welcome revelation.
Setting:
Location: Sarah's Luxury Suite at the Grandeur Hotel. 
Weather/Environment: A clear night.
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Sarah, Evan
Secondary Characters: None
Character Emotional State:
Sarah: Apprehensive, Nervous, Excited, Amorous.
Evan: Excited, Amorous.
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)
Dialogue Focus: Moderate
Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate
Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
After Nina had left to deliver the envelope to Evan, an immediate shot of fear consumed Sarah. Inexperienced in true intimacy within a loving relationship, she was at a loss for what to do. Uncertain of what to wear or where to position herself as she awaited Evan's arrival, she was gripped by indecision and doubt.
She thought to herself, If only I had planned this ahead of time, I would have purchased elegant lingerie for the moment. But none of what I have will suffice.
Ultimately, she decided to undress completely and lie in bed beneath the covers, with both the sheet and comforter pulled up over her chest. Her choice was marked by caution, as she was nervous about revealing too much of her body, and it reflected the genuine, vulnerable anticipation she felt for this significant step in their relationship.
Middle:
Sarah's nerves rose to a peak as she heard the key card unlocking the door, the sound of a click that seemed to echo loudly in the room.
Evan entered slowly and gently closed the door.
[ When Evan saw Sarah looking at the door, describe the detail of a romance novelist, his reaction to seeing his beautiful love awaiting him. ]
Evan smiled and looked at Sarah. 
She nervously smiled back.
Evan presumed that she was fully undressed, hiding under the blanket, so he undressed and slid under the blanket next to her.
Sarah lay rigid and stiff, with her hands tightly holding the blanket in position. Evan leaned in and kissed her gently.
Evan's kiss did not free Sarah from her nearly petrified state of anxiety.
Evan encouraged her to relax and let her know that everything was going to be okay.
Seeing she was so nervous, he asked Sarah what was the cause of her anxiousness.
Sarah: &quot;I don't have experience making love. I don't think I'm going to be any good at it, at least not the first time.&quot; 
[ Evan chuckled, finding Sarah's comments adorably amusing. ]
Evan: &quot;Before we kissed for the first time, did you think you weren't going to be any good at kissing?&quot;
[ Evan's question caused Sarah to think for a moment, allowing her body to relax a little bit as she contemplated the question. ]
Sarah: &quot;I didn't have time to think about it. The kiss happened naturally.&quot;
[ Sarah paused and then continued. ]
Sarah: &quot;If I had thought about it, I would have presumed, having little experience, that I would not have been a very good kisser.&quot;
[ Evan smiled, hoping Sarah got his point. ]
Evan: &quot;Let me tell you. That kiss and every kiss since has been amazing. However it goes tonight, it's going to be incredible. Because, I love you and that's what matters.”
[ Evan's words comforted Sarah and melted her simultaneously. Her whole body relaxed, and she was ready. Ready not just to make love but to finally say the words that Evan promised to cherish. Sarah's eyes watered. ]
Sarah: &quot;I love you too, Evan. I love you so much!&quot;
[ No verbal response from Evan was needed. His facial expression and smile told the story. ]
End: 
[ This book is not erotica. However, I would like the end of this scene to be written in the style of a romance novelist. ]
Sarah released her tight grip on the covers and relaxed her arms.
She and Evan kissed softly and sensually, while Evan's hands explored her body, feeling the softness of her skin, causing her body to tingle and yearn for more.
She found her hands naturally exploring Evan's body. Almost as if her hands had a mind of their own. The feel of his sculpted body increased her desire dramatically.
Finally, the moment was right. Evan and Sarah made soft, sensual love for the first time.
Objectives/Goals:
In this scene, the readers see that Sarah has finally let go of her resistance to loving Evan.
This is the scene where she emphatically professes her love, and overcomes her apprehension about making love. With fear, resistance, and apprehension out of the way, Sarah and Evan made sensual love.
Props/Items:
Key card to unlock Sarah's room.
Sheets.

            <Notes>In a funny moment, Sarah tells Evan she may not be any good their first time. Evan smiles and said to do thinking be any good at kissing. But if I had time to think about, I would've said no I didn't think I'd be any good. Well then, were in luck because you are a fantastic kisser.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Though in her academic haven, the undergrad library, Sarah finds herself unable to concentrate. Distracted by thoughts of Evan, her usual scholarly focus is replaced by a restless mind. Her studies take a back seat as she grapples with her unexpected emotions.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: Sarah Can't Concentrate
Summary: Though in her academic haven, the undergrad library, Sarah finds herself unable to concentrate. Distracted by thoughts of Evan, her usual scholarly focus is replaced by a restless mind. Her studies take a back seat as she grapples with her unexpected emotions..
Characters: Sarah
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective 
Location: Undergrad Library - Remember that this library is underground with no windows.
Time of Day: Morning
Tone: Jumbled emotions and internal conflict.
Weather: The weather outside is perfect, but the library is underground, so the current state of the weather is not apparent.
Special Instructions: 
To keep the scene interesting, consider making Sarah's nervous energy and inability to focus cause her to perform menial tasks. Such as:
- Straighten up the work area in front of her.
- Clean her eyeglasses.
- Organize her purse.
- Aimlessly searching through the aisles of books, pulling out and putting back books she knows she has no intention of reading.
- etc.

There is no outward dialogue in this scene. This is a set-up scene, so the reader will know Sarah's mindset in the moments before Evan finally finds her in the library. I really want the reader to feel like she's there with Sarah. Helpful to accomplish that goal will be a complete, vivid description of the inside of the library. The undergrad library is not overly quiet, although no one's allowed to yell or scream. I will provide a narrative to describe the library for this scene. Feel free to use it as is or modify it as needed.
Undergrad Library Description:
The Undergraduate Library was a flurry of activity and bright, relentless fluorescent lighting. Instead of a quiet sanctuary, it was a hub of engagement, a hive buzzing with the energy of youthful minds. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a stark, almost clinical glow over the rows of tables and chairs, making the room feel less like a typical library and more like a vibrant community center.
Groups of students huddled together at the tables, doing their best to keep their voices down but often failing in those efforts, as evidenced by scolding looks from others trying to study.
In corners and along the aisles between bookshelves, there were pockets of flirtation. Amidst the academic pursuit, the library also served as a social arena, a meeting point for like-minded individuals who could connect over shared study materials and the occasional whispered joke. A glance stolen across the study table, a shy smile in response to a witty remark, the quiet exchange of notes - these were as common in the library as textbooks and highlighters.
It was more than a library; it was a microcosm of college life, a blend of hard work, cooperation, and the undercurrent of budding romance. Students came for the books but stayed for the energy and camaraderie that hummed through the bright, lively room.
Sequence of Events:
I want a vivid description of the undergrad library as the backdrop for Sarah's internal conflict and lack of focus. 
Integrate Sarah's emotions and inner thoughts as you describe the library’s environment.
Somewhere in the scene, Sarah puts her hair in a bun. It's important that this happens for reasons that become apparent as our story continues.
For the first time in her college career, Sarah couldn't focus on her academic work. 
Whenever she tried to study, her mind wandered back to the kiss and the man who kissed her.
Sarah felt like an observer as her mind split in two. The left side of her brain reminded her of her vow to avoid romance, the right side embracing the feeling of every cell of her body craving romance, craving just one more kiss.
Sarah thought, “Is this what all women feel like when attracted to a man? How do they ever get anything done?&quot;
Try as she might, Sarah could not overcome the distraction her thoughts of Evan were causing.
She felt lucky that she was always way ahead in her schoolwork. Otherwise, she would be in trouble. She had accomplished virtually nothing in the days following the kiss.</Text>

Title: The Drive to the Post-Game Party
Summary:
On the drive to the restaurant for a celebratory post-game party, Evan and Sarah discuss her inaugural experience attending a softball game and how things went with Evan's friends. Sarah shares her insecurities about attending the party.
Setting:
Location: Sarah's Pearl White Audi luxury sedan.
Location Description: The late-model Pearl White Audi luxury sedan was a masterpiece of German engineering, sleek and sophisticated in design. Its exterior was painted in a lustrous pearl white hue, a color that gleamed with a soft iridescence under the sunlight. The paint seemed to possess a life of its own, reflecting the world around it with a luxurious shine that turned heads wherever it went.
The sedan's sharp, angular lines added to its aerodynamic appearance, giving it an aggressive yet elegant stance. The iconic four-ring Audi emblem adorned the front grille, which was flanked by LED headlights that featured a distinctive shape and emitted a bright, clear light. These eyes of the vehicle looked both futuristic and intent, ready to pierce through the darkest nights.
The car's side profile showcased its sweeping contours and pronounced wheel arches, housing gleaming alloy wheels with intricately designed spokes. Chrome trim added subtle accents along the windows and door handles, contrasting beautifully with the pearl white body.
Inside, the Audi was as refined as it was on the outside. The interior was a blend of luxury and technology, featuring leather seats that were both supple and supportive. The dashboard was a marvel of ergonomic design, with a digital display that provided the driver with all essential information at a glance. The center console was equipped with an advanced infotainment system, giving access to navigation, music, and various connectivity options through a touchscreen interface.
The cabin was spacious and well-lit, with meticulous attention to detail visible in the stitching and the use of high-quality materials. Ambient lighting could be adjusted to suit the mood, and advanced noise-cancellation technology ensured a serene driving experience.
Under the hood, the car's engine was a piece of art itself, a combination of performance and efficiency that delivered a smooth yet thrilling driving experience. Whether cruising on the highway or navigating city streets, the Audi sedan responded with agility and precision, its suspension tuned to provide a ride that was both comfortable and engaging.
In every aspect, the Pearl White Audi luxury sedan was a symbol of status and taste, a vehicle that combined aesthetics, comfort, and performance in a way that was uniquely Audi. It was not just a car, but an expression of a lifestyle.
Time: After the game is over, Shortly after 1 PM
Weather/Environment: Partly sunny, warm, and comfortable.
Tone: Neutral. With hints of nervousness and playfulness.
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Sarah, Evan
Secondary Characters: None
Character Emotional State:
Evan: Evan is feeling great! His team won the game. He scored the winning run. And his new girlfriend is right by his side, experiencing it all with him.
Sarah: Sarah has mixed emotions. She felt awkward at times during the game. She is extremely nervous about the post-game party. At the same time, she feels good that she's with Evan.
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)
Dialogue Focus: Heavy
Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate
Plot/Action:
Beginning: Evan and Sarah climb into the car for a 15-minute drive to the &quot;Sluggers&quot; sports bar and grill. 
Middle: Evan inquires about her experience at her first softball game. This scene is made up of their conversation. See the dialogue for more information about what is said.
End: Sarah pulled up into the parking lot of sluggers, and a terrified feeling engulfed her. Evan can see the fear inside of her and does his best to comfort and reassure her.
Objectives/Goals:
We want the reader to see that Sarah is doing her best to support Evan while struggling outside her comfort zone.
It's not just that she's unacquainted with a typical college student atmosphere. She has never been a girlfriend before and is still determining how to fulfill that role for Evan.
The scene should also show how Sarah's feelings are growing for Evan. Although softball was not her thing, she enjoyed being there for Evan and enjoyed watching Evan enjoy himself playing the game.
Props/Items:
Sarah's pendant. In this scene, Sarah is seen rubbing Evan's pendant while waiting at a stoplight. She is subconsciously using it like a worry stone. Evan is pleased that she's wearing it and that she seems to like it. Without Evan asking or saying anything, Sarah tells Evan how much she loves the pendant. Include this in the scene.
Dialogue:
Key Lines:
Evan: &quot;So, how was it, experiencing your first softball game.”
Sarah: &quot;It was fun! Especially at the end. I loved watching you score the final run!”
Evan: &quot;So you enjoyed the game?”
Sarah: &quot;Honestly, I'll probably never be a huge fan. But I enjoyed watching you play.”
Evan: &quot;I can live with that. How’d it go with my friends?”
Sarah: “We didn't really talk much. They were focused on the game, and I spent a lot of time trying to learn the game from my book. Patti seems really nice.”
Evan: &quot;Patti is great. I think you two will hit it off once you get to know each other.”
Sarah: &quot;Evan, I'm nervous about the post-game party and hanging out with your friends in general. I'm so different than them. Besides Patti, I don't think they liked me very much.”
Evan: &quot;Give it time. Everyone's nervous in a situation like this. They'll warm up to you soon enough.”
Sarah (upon arriving at the sports bar): &quot;I am starting to freak out. I don't know if I can do this. I don't think I'm ready yet.”
Evan: “You'll be fine. But if you're not ready, let's go somewhere else. They'll be plenty of opportunities to get to know my friends and vice versa.”
Sarah: “I've never been anyone's girlfriend before. I don't want to suck at it.”
Evan: “You don't and won't suck at it. Come on, let's go somewhere else.”
Sarah: “No. It will make things worse if you don't show up after scoring the winning run. They'll know I caused you to be a no-show at the party. I'll be okay.”
Tone: Sarah gets increasingly nervous as she nears the sports bar. Evan does his best to comfort her when he sees her inner nerves escaping outwardly.
Action Tags/Dialogue Tags:
Evan laughs affectionately when Sarah worries about sucking as a girlfriend.
Evan is patient and compassionate about her concerns, frequently holding her hand and using words and gestures to make her feel comfortable and let her know there's no pressure to go to the post-game party.
Sarah is nervous. She is ultra comfortable in her world but ultra uncomfortable in Evan's world. However, Sarah is intent on being good in anything she does. This includes being good at being Evan's girlfriend.

            <Title>0212 Study Session First</Title>
            <Synopsis>Expecting a date night at Sarah's apartment, Evan learns that academics come first for Sarah. As part of their agreement, Sarah tutors Evan on methods to improve his grades. Only after the tutor session can their date begin.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The rain poured down in torrents, a distant rumble of thunder announcing a storm that was still a ways off. Sarah stood at her apartment door, her heart pounding in her chest as anticipation bubbled within her. She peeked through the peephole just as Evan arrived, shaking the water from his umbrella before leaving it outside.
Opening the door, Sarah's face broke into a giant smile, and she wrapped Evan in a warm hug, followed by a soft, sensual kiss. &quot;I missed you,&quot; Evan whispered, his voice filled with longing. &quot;Four days felt like four weeks.&quot;
Sarah's heart swelled, and she echoed his sentiment, pulling him into more passionate kisses. But with a playful smile, she pulled back and wagged her finger from left to right. &quot;Uh uh uh, Study first, kissing last.&quot;
Evan's brows shot up in confusion, but it all made sense when Sarah revealed her secret plan: a tutoring session to kickstart their date. Like a cute but reluctant child not getting his way, Evan eventually agreed, charmed by Sarah's unexpected commitment to their agreement.
Once settled in, they began to study. Sarah's dining room table was covered in books and study materials, all prepared with care. Evan's initial reluctance faded as he realized the effort she'd put into the lesson. They worked together for the next hour. Sarah guided him with patience and clarity.
Occasionally, the sound of rain grew more intense, the distant flashes of lightning adding a sense of urgency to their task. Sarah paid attention to every detail, even bringing Evan his favorite beer, chilled to perfection.
Time flew, and the studying took on a rhythm of its own. Evan found himself drawn into the subjects, appreciating Sarah's method of teaching and the way she made complex topics accessible.
Finally, the study session ended, and Sarah complimented Evan on his hard work. &quot;I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would,&quot; Evan admitted, a hint of surprise in his voice. &quot;My sister is going to love you for helping me like this!  I think I understand this better now, thanks to you.&quot;
They indulged in a short-lived sensual kissing session before Sarah pulled away, her eyes twinkling. &quot;Time to order dinner,&quot; she said, waving the pizza menus in front of him.
As they browsed the options, the rain outside grew steadily worse, a distant thunder signaling the storm's approach. But inside Sarah's apartment, the atmosphere was warm and cozy, filled with the promise of a perfect date night.</Text>

            <Title>Part 1: Intro</Title>
            <Text>As they entered the upscale, modern apartment, Sarah and Katie naturally diverged. For Katie, unaccustomed to such luxury, the entire space was a marvel. She was entranced, her gaze traveling over the tastefully minimalist decor, pristine cleanliness, and the blend of modern furniture. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view of an untouched nature preserve in central Illinois—an unexpected gem, offering a green oasis laced with a shimmering creek.
&quot;Wow, Sarah, your place is amazing!&quot; Katie marveled, her voice slightly echoing in the vast space. She found herself gravitating toward the panoramic view, her footfalls soft against the gleaming hardwood floor.
In response, Sarah, already heading toward the kitchen, dismissively gestured with her hand. &quot;It's just home,&quot; she called back. &quot;Make yourself comfortable, Katie. Want something to drink? Coffee? Water? Or maybe a glass of wine?&quot;
Katie, still mesmerized by the vast preserve, turned at Sarah's words. &quot;Oh, I'd love some wine, but still a few years away,&quot; she said with a smirk. &quot;Better make it water.&quot;
Sarah let out a chuckle, &quot;Oh, I didn't even think about that,&quot; she admitted, her tone light and amused.
Katie said, &quot;You must be rich!&quot;
&quot;I'm not, but my father is. He owns a large corporation and pays the bills.&quot; Sarah explained as she finished pouring the drinks. She  gestured to the plush seating area that faced the scenic outdoors. &quot;Have a seat on the couch.&quot; 
Katie's youthful energy was infectious, her eyes wide with awe and excitement. &quot;Oh, my God! I love this place!&quot; Her voice rang out with pure delight, echoing around the room before she took an arm's open, playful back plunge onto the couch, her body sinking comfortably into its plush cushions. Her laughter filled the room, a joyful melody wrapped around them like a comforting blanket.
Holding a glass of chilled wine in one hand and a glass of water in the other, Sarah watched with a smile playing on her lips. She was amused by Katie's genuine delight, the vibrancy in the younger woman's eyes reflecting a life very different from her own. 
Sarah gracefully handed Katie the glass of water, then nestled into the other end of the couch, curling her legs underneath her. She held her glass of wine comfortably as she faced Katie, their eyes meeting in a silent agreement to embark on a girlish chat.

Title: Patti Seeks Advice from Guido
Summary:
Patti hesitantly tells Guido that their friends have tasked her with convincing Evan that his relationship with Sarah is wrong. Despite not being fond of Guido, Patti appreciates his candid views on Evan and Sarah's relationship, even if they sometimes irk her. Their conversation is marked by a tangled mix of emotions, differing allegiances, and a mutual worry for Evan..
Leading Context:
This scene picks up after Evan leaves for his first Fundraising event. Here is the last paragraph before this scene:
“As Evan left the room, Patti lingered, her hand tracing the spot where she’d tied his tie. The moment was over, but the feelings lingered. She sighed, knowing she’d made the right choice, but it didn’t make it any easier.”
Setting:
Location: Evan and Guido’s apartment
Time: Early evening
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Patti, Guido
Character Emotional State:
Patti: Upset and conflicted
Guido: Surprisingly compassionate
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Patti)
Dialogue Focus: Heavy
Use of Internal Dialogue: Moderate
Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
Patti plops down on the sofa after Evan leaves for Sarah’s fundraising event
Guido can see that Patti is upset and assumes that she didn’t leave the apartment after Evan left, indicating that she needs someone to talk to. Guido interrupts his unfruitful journey through his little black book, calling women for a night of fun.
He says, “I know you’re not my biggest fan, but if you need someone to talk to, I’m here.”
Patti confides to Guido that, on the notes to him, their inner circle of friends has asked her to persuade Evan that his relationship with Sarah is misguided.
Guido realizes this will be a more extended conversation than he had hoped. He goes to the fridge, grabs two beers, opens them, hands one to Sarah, and takes a guzzle from his beer bottle. He then sits down on the loveseat at a 90° angle from the sofa, sharing the same end table.
Middle: 
She tells Guido that she doesn’t know if she can do it.
She admits that she still has feelings for Evan but still values Evan’s friendship.
Evan may be unaware of Patti’s conflict, but Guido has always known.
She asks him what he thinks of Evan and Sarah’s relationship.
He explains how he doesn’t get Evan. In his opinion, Evan should enjoy his college years as Guido does. He comments how Evan has it easy. Girls flock to Evan while he(Guido) has to work for his girls. He says if he were Evan, he’d be playing the field – A different girl every other night of the week.
Then he switches gears and says, but Evan is Evan. 
Patti didn’t get the answer she sought, so she asked again about his feelings but Evans’s relationship with Sarah. “Do you think she’s right for him?”
Not accustomed to these situations, Guido’s unsure if she’s seeking consolation or candor. He asks her, “You want me to sugarcoat it, or do you want Guido to give it to you raw?”
Patti: “Neither, really. But I guess there’s no point in you holding back, so give it to me raw.”
Guido: “Not that I could ever think like Evan when it comes to women, but I thought you and him were doing it right. You’re both in college, having fun, but no strings attached. You are smoking hot. I would’ve kept hooking up through senior year if I were Evan. “
Patti: “What do you think about Sarah?”
Guido: “What I say here never leaves this room. Do we have an understanding?”
Patti: “Yes, of course. I won’t tell anyone, even Roxanne.”
Guido: “I don’t get it. I don’t get it at all. They have very little in common. But maybe that’s the point?”
Patti: “What do you mean?”
Guido: “I marvel at how Evan attracts women when he knows so little about them. It might even say I’m green with envy. I can only imagine what it’s like to have girls lined up at my front door.”
Patti: “I don’t understand your point.”
Guido (annoyed by her impatience): “That’s because you didn’t let me finish. If it’s that easy for him to get a girl, then maybe what attracts him to Sarah is that although he reeled her in pretty quickly, for the first time, he experienced a girl who made him work for it. See what I mean.”
Patti thought for a while and began to understand what Guido was saying.
Patti: “You may be right. I never really thought about it that way.”
Guido: “Of course I’m right. The Guido is always right.”
Patti: “Now that she’s been ‘caught,’” Patti said air quoting the word caught. “Do you think he’ll lose interest and back away?”
Guido: “I know you may not wanna hear this, but the only way that relationship ends is if Sarah ends it. Evan is convinced she’s the one regardless of what you and I think.  His words, not mine. When Evan commits to something, it’s impossible to derail him.”
Patti: “Why can’t he see what we all see? Sooner or later, that relationship is going to stop working. He needs to get out now before things get too serious.”
Guido: “Oh Patti, Patti, Patti, you’re not getting it. Evan is in love with Sarah, or at least he thinks he is. He won’t admit it, and nobody seems to understand this, but Evan is the epitome of a hopeless romantic. He is blinded by love. I doubt anything we say will open his eyes to reality.”
Patti: “I’m not sure what to do. As a friend, I think I should share what we all feel and warn him off, Sarah. But I’m not sure if I trust my motivation. I don’t want to come off as a jealous ex.”
Guido: “I decided to let Evan make his own mistakes. And be there for him when he inevitably crashes and burns.”
Patti: “Is that what you think I should do? Just back away and let him crash and burn? Hoping that when he sees Sarah’s not right for him, maybe he’ll see that there are better options for him, even if it’s not me.”
Guido: “Yes and no. I know there’s nothing I can say to stop you from warning Evan off of Sarah. I could see it in your eyes.”
Patti: “I don’t want to, Guido. But Roxanne made it clear that if I don’t do it, she will. That would be a disaster on all levels.”
Guido: “I get it. And who knows, maybe something you say will click down the road. But for now, understand that your words will fall on deaf ears. And then you’re left with a tough choice.”
Patti: “Choice?”
Guido: “Either tell Evan how you feel and press the issue with Sarah or be his friend and be happy for him if it works out, and be there to catch him if he falls.”
Patti: “That’s pretty sound advice coming from you.”
Guido: “Everyone always underestimates the Guido.”
Patti: “I don’t know if I can stand around waiting and watching him with Sarah.”
Guido: “Then don’t. Get back out there yourself. Find yourself a dude to keep your bed warm at night. You still got almost two full years of college. Live it up!”
Patti laughed: “Now that’s the kind of advice I expected from you, Guido.”
End: 
Guido: “I’m not gonna lie. I’d be happy to fill that need for your right now. But no can do.”
Patti laughs loudly. “I can’t wait to hear this. Why ‘no can do’?”
Guido: “I’ve practically made a living off Evan’s rejects. But once a girl does Evan, she’s off-limits to the Guido. I don’t do my friends like that.”
Patti laughed, not sure what to say.
Guido: “I gotta tell you, though, Patti. It ain’t easy. You’re the hottest piece of ass Evan’s ever brought to bed.”
Guido could see Patti waiting for a finish to his thought. So he gave her what she needed, earnest in his words.
Guido continued: “And yes, even hotter than Sarah.”
Provide deeper POV and internal dialogue here indicating that while Patti would usually be offended by Guido calling her a hot piece of ass, she was flattered.
Have her respond however you see fit.
This scene ends with Guido being interrupted by one of his prized black book coeds returning his call. He tells Patti he’s got to go. Telling her he’s got a live one on the hook.
The last paragraph should be about Patti leaving the apartment, trying to figure out what to do. Her conflict is still unresolved.
Special instructions:
I've presented comprehensive dialogue that needs to be included in the scene.
Please add narrative, action tags, and dialogue tags to beef up the scene.
This is a deep POV scene reflecting's Patti's thoughts. Describing her thoughts and implementing inner dialogue when needed make sure that the reader understands how Patti feels as she talks to Guido about everything.
The scene is meant to show that there is more to Guido than meets the eye, but at the end of the day, he is still Guido.
The combination of drama and humor is meant to to entertain the reader.</Text>

            <Title>Evan's POV</Title>
            <Text>Evan strode into the library, his eyes scanning the sea of tables and bookshelves. It was a shot in the dark to think he would recognize her in such a large crowd. But there, towards the back, sat a figure dressed in a business suit with hair wound in a tight bun. His heart leapt. The mystery woman from their unexpected encounter.

She was already watching him, he noticed as he headed her way. A blush bloomed across her cheeks, and she tried to hide her face behind the book she was holding. He held back a chuckle. There was something endearing about the sight of her trying to hide behind a dense medical textbook. 

As he approached, she peeked up at him over the edge of the book, eyes wide. She set the book down and straightened in her seat, her chest rising and falling a bit too quickly. Holding out the pair of glasses he had fixed, he asked, &quot;May I?&quot; 

Her breath hitched slightly, but she gave a hesitant nod, her eyes fluttering closed as his hands moved toward her face. He gently removed her current glasses and replaced them with the repaired pair.

&quot;Ah, much better,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;Not that there's anything wrong with the glasses you were wearing, but I like these a lot better. I hope I did a good job fixing them?&quot; 

Her eyes blinked open, adjusting to the new lenses. &quot;Yes, you did. Thank you. How much do I owe you?&quot; 

His smile widened. &quot;You don’t owe me anything! But you can join me for a snack at the food court. We could call it an energy exchange?&quot;

She hesitated, biting her lip. &quot;I have studying to do.&quot;

He gave her a playful grin. &quot;You can’t take a half-hour break?&quot; 

&quot;I have a lot to study,&quot; she insisted.

&quot;Well, I have to study too!&quot; He disappeared briefly behind a bookshelf, returning moments later with a book of his own. He sat across from her, intentionally holding his book upside down.

&quot;Do you always read your books upside down?&quot; she asked, failing to suppress a laugh.

He flipped the book, revealing the title - Female Poets of the 19th Century. &quot;Ah, now this book makes more sense!&quot; he replied, chuckling at his own joke. 

Her laugh filled the air between them. “Can you even name one?” she teased.

“Emily Dickinson!” he shot back confidently.

“Do you know that, or is she the only female poet you’ve heard of?”

“I am an expert on female poetry from the 19th century!” he declared, and her laughter filled the room once again.

His charm was chipping away at her resolve, he noticed as she attempted to return to her study materials. He opened the book again, altering his tone to mimic a professor's. &quot;Very nice. Excellent poetic structure. Great use of hyperbole.&quot;

“You are going to keep annoying me until I agree to go to the food court, aren’t you?” she said, trying to stifle her giggles.

“Annoying? I was shooting for charming!” he exclaimed, feigning shock. Her laughter echoed around them.

“Okay, fine, annoyingly charming.”

He sobered a bit, &quot;I’ll stop bothering you if you want. But I say let’s get to know each other. Unless I imagined it, that kiss was wonderful for you, too. All I’m asking for is 15 minutes. That’s it, just 15 minutes of your time! What do you say?”

Silence hung in the air as she seemed to weigh his words, finally relenting as she packed up her things. &quot;Is that a yes?&quot; he asked, already knowing the answer.

“Yes, it is!” She smiled at him, and it was all the confirmation he needed.
As they readied to leave, Evan stepped aside, gesturing for her to lead the way. With a small smile, she passed him, and he followed, reaching the door first to hold it open for her. Together, they stepped out into the perfect morning sunlight. A sense of anticipation, a blossoming of something new and exciting, filled the air. The scene was set - there was chemistry, there was romance, and there was a whole world waiting for them to explore together. 
*The author's style used in this scene was Romantic and Realistic.*</Text>

            <Title>WIP with more narrative</Title>
            <Text>Sarah's feet were brisk against the sidewalk, the rhythm of her steps resonating with the morning's hurried energy. Yet, her speed wasn't enough. She heard Evan's voice calling out behind her, his tone playfully admonishing, &quot;Hey, Cinderella, wait up!&quot;
She halted in her tracks, her heart thrumming in her chest. Turning back, she faced him, a bewildered expression etched on her face. &quot;Why do you call me Cinderella?&quot;
Evan's easy smile danced in the sunlight, as though he were a character plucked straight from a charming romance novel. His eyes, bright with humor, crinkled at the corners. &quot;Because you’re always running away from me like it’s midnight.”
“And why are you so adamant about chasing after me?&quot; She countered, a defiant edge lacing her words. &quot;It’s clear there are plenty of adoring females that would welcome your attention.&quot;
Caught in the gravity of his gaze, Sarah noted the determination etched in his features. &quot;I want to learn more about you,&quot; Evan stated simply, standing tall in his conviction. &quot;What’s wrong with that?”
Sarah huffed, her chest rising and falling with the rhythm of her disbelief. &quot;It doesn’t take a genius to see that we exist in different worlds.”
His laughter, unexpected and genuine, echoed around them. “Let me guess. You’re a genius?”
“That’s not my point.”
The tranquility of Evan's demeanor was compelling. His gaze was patient and unwavering as he prompted, “Then what is your point?”
“As a couple, we make little sense. I came to college to get an education and network with professionals to further my academic and professional careers. I committed to focusing on my work and refraining from distracting relationships. You don’t need me. You must know every female on campus.”
Evan smiled, his grin a heartrending blend of sincerity and charm. “Are you jealous? You have nothing to worry about.”
&quot;I’m not jealous. I simply can’t understand why you’re focusing your attention on me,&quot; Sarah replied, her arms crossed over her chest, a physical barrier to the emotions threatening to spill over. Her eyes, brimming with questions, searched his.
Evan looked at her, his gaze reflecting a mix of curiosity and genuine interest. &quot;I don't know, Sarah. There's just something about you. You're different from the girls I'm used to meeting.&quot;
&quot;You don't even know me,&quot; she countered, her voice softer than intended, her gaze shifting to the ground, avoiding his penetrating stare.
He nodded, acknowledging her point. &quot;That's true,&quot; he admitted, a breeze lifting a lock of his hair as he met her gaze again. &quot;But let me ask you something. Why did you kiss me? Why are you here with me now instead of studying?&quot;
Her response was a mere whisper, lost amidst the symphony of the city sounds around them. She shifted on her feet, her foot tracing an absent pattern on the pavement. &quot;Other than the obvious…&quot; she began, implying Evan's good looks. Her voice tapered off to a whisper, &quot;I don't know either.&quot;
A persuasive plea was etched in Evan's eyes as he stepped closer to her, the distance between them shrinking to a mere breath. &quot;Well, let's find out together,&quot; he said earnestly, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Go to dinner with me.”
Silence enveloped them, the sounds of the bustling city fading into a distant hum. Evan waited for her answer, each second stretching into an eternity. Finally, when the silence had stretched too long, Evan added, “College is about relationships, having fun, trying new things.”
Sarah resisted, but the inner argument she was having with herself was evident in the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes. &quot;I made a plan that makes sense, and I’ve held to it for three years.”
“Doesn’t it make sense to enjoy your college life? To be well-rounded? To pursue new relationships?” Evan countered.
Sarah was exasperated. She wasn’t used to someone challenging her perspective so effectively. “You’ve got my head spinning. It doesn’t help that every time you kiss me, my IQ drops 50 points. How can my plan make so much sense, yet your opposite approach makes sense too?”
His next words caught her off guard. &quot;How can a piece of paper be both thin and wide?”
Before she could formulate an answer, Evan leaned in to kiss her again. The taste of his kiss was sweet and confusing, a turmoil of emotions, leaving her breathless. Pulling back, Evan proposed again. “Thursday night, dinner at seven at the Thai Garden?&quot;
After a moment of hesitance, she relented. &quot;Alright, I’ll meet you there at seven.”
Evan's joy was infectious as he clapped his hands together. “That’s awesome! Can I get your phone number? Your last name?”
&quot;Let’s wait and see how it goes,&quot; Sarah replied cautiously.
He nodded, accepting her boundaries. As she turned to leave, he extended his hand. “May I walk you to your car?”
The walk was silent, their hands intertwined, a silent promise of what was to come. When they reached her car, Evan leaned in, hopeful. “May I get a kiss goodbye?”
“Of course.” She answered, her breath steadier now.
The kiss was long and tender, filled with promises of the potential for something more. Pulling away, Evan teased, “How’s that IQ doing?”
Sarah responded with an unusual attempt at humor. “2+2 equals 10.”
Laughter filled the air, a comforting and intimate sound. When it finally faded, Evan's eyes held a hint of concern. “I’m afraid to let you go. I’m worried you won’t show up on Thursday.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. I never break an appointment unless it’s an emergency.” Sarah's voice was steady, and Evan could see the resolve in her eyes, a promise of the adventure to come.</Text>

            <Title>Sarahs Mother - Mildred Wilkins</Title>
            <Text>Character Profile:
Name: Mildred Wilkins
Gender: Female
Age: Mid-60s
Current residence: Seattle, Washington
Vehicle Driven: Mercedes-Benz
Resembles: Actor Meryl Streep
Eye Color: Blue
Hair Color: Gray
Height: 5’6”
Body type: Slender
Relationships: Wife to Jack Wilkins. Mother of Sarah Wilkins.
Personality traits: 
In terms of brand archetypes, her would be considered a Caregiver.
Her Myers-Briggs archetype is INFJ.
Notes:
Born in central Illinois.
She met Jack in high school when she was a junior, and he was a senior.
She worked various low-paying jobs while Jack attended a nearby college.
They were married shortly after he graduated.
Mildred was a dutiful wife to an authoritative husband.
She was not in any way abused; Jack treated her well. It's just that he was the primary decision-maker on any critical decisions. Mildred and Jack were rarely out of sync, regardless of who made the decision.
She eventually became an assistant office manager, where Jack worked after college.
After a few years, Jack was ready to start his own company, and Mildred followed him. She worked almost as many hours as Jack doing whatever needed, from cleaning the office to managing the books.
The company grew quickly, and shortly after that, Sarah was born. Once Sarah was born, Mildred voted to be a mother and wife.
Mildred was a tad more expressive than her husband or daughter and often felt like a third wheel. That being said, she was fulfilled by her role as mother and wife and had no desire to return to the corporate world. She enjoyed her life after Sarah was born.
When there were times that she disagreed with Jack's decision, especially about Sarah's upbringing, she would speak up. However, if Jack pushed back, Mildred would bite her tongue and acquiesce.

Character Description: 
In her mid-60s, Mildred Wilkins exudes a quiet, dignified grace. Her eyes, a vibrant blue, mirror those of her husband, Jack, and their only child, Sarah. She possesses a slim figure, standing at a modest 5'6&quot;, and carries herself with an air of serene confidence. 
Born and raised in Central Illinois, Mildred's life took a significant turn when she met Jack during her junior year of high school. The pair were inseparable from then on. Even as Jack progressed through college, Mildred stood by him, juggling various low-paying jobs to support their budding relationship. Their bond solidified when they got married shortly after Jack's graduation.
Mildred was a steadfast companion to her authoritative husband, Jack. Their dynamic was harmonious, even though Jack predominantly held the reins of decision-making. Jack treated her with respect and kindness, never overstepping the boundaries into mistreatment or abuse.
Following Jack into the corporate world, Mildred worked alongside him in various roles, from office cleaning to bookkeeping. She proved herself to be versatile, a characteristic that would serve her well when they embarked on the journey of starting their own company.
The birth of Sarah ushered in a new chapter in Mildred's life. She chose to step back from the corporate world, dedicating herself to the roles of mother and wife. Though she occasionally felt like a third wheel in the intellectually intense dynamics between Jack and Sarah, she found fulfillment in her chosen path.
Mildred's personality was a tad more expressive than her husband's or her daughter's. When she disagreed with Jack's decisions, especially concerning Sarah's upbringing, she wasn't afraid to voice her concerns. But when met with resistance, she would often yield, valuing harmony over conflict. Nonetheless, her influence was a gentle but firm grounding force in their family life, providing a balance to Jack's authoritative stance and Sarah's ambition. Mildred loved her life and cherished her role as a loving mother and a supportive wife.</Text>

            <Title>Prepped Scenes</Title>
            <Notes>Plot Summary:
For two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, it's early in the first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Sarah and Evan do not run in the same circles and have never met. 
Evan is a handsome, athletic man adored by the female coeds and well-liked by everyone. He is popular, but not by choice. His natural charisma and outgoing personality naturally draw others to him, however, under the tutelage of his saint of her sister, Liz. He doesn't let his popularity inflate his ego. He treats everybody with care and kindness – whether they be the captain of the football team or a nerdy water boy.
Evan could be a better student. Not because he lacks the intelligence to get good grades but because he'd rather spend his time enjoying the outdoors stuffed in a classroom or locked indoors doing homework assignments.
However, Evan promised his sister Liz that he would make an effort and graduate with a minimum of a 3.0 GPA. Entering his senior year, his GPA was hovering precariously around that mark. Much to his skirt-chasing friend Guido's chagrin, Evan stopped playing Frisbee and headed to the undergrad library for some study time. It was essential for Evan to keep his promise to Liz.
Sarah, on the other hand, is a brilliant student. Certain to graduate at the top of her class, she considers the undergrad library her academic haven. She is there, wearing her earbuds,  listening to a riveting audio seminar on techniques for successfully doing business internationally.
As a business major and teacher's assistant, she teaches a Business-101 class to first-year students once a week. Immersed in her audio seminar, she neglected to keep track of time and suddenly realized she was in danger of being late for the class she was to teach – which has never happened. Sarah is never late for anything.
Anxious to finish listening to the last few minutes of her audio seminar, Sarah leaves her earbuds in her ears. She rushes up the stairs of the underground library and juts out the door onto a raised campus platform.
`Evan is heading toward Sarah, recognizing that she is not paying attention to her surroundings, and is about to encounter four concrete steps leading downward. These steps are 40 feet wide, with only a few railings scattered throughout. She is headed to the part of the stairs with no handrail to catch herself if she falls.
Evan's call to her goes unnoticed. He jets towards her with little time to spare, hoping to intercept her before she gets to the stairs.
He arrived just in time to catch her. Her momentum caused him to spin her around and dip her as though they were in a dance. Their eyes meet, and they experience a long passionate kiss.
She was raised to focus on academics and prepare to work for her father's multimillion-dollar corporation when she graduates. The ultimate plan is that she replace him as CEO when he's ready to retire.
Although Sarah is very beautiful, she has minimal experience in relationships with the opposite sex. She had promised herself and her father that she would avoid all romantic entanglements until she graduated with her Masters’s degree and was ready to start a professional career.
Sarah's social activity is limited to the wealthy contacts she makes in her volunteer role as an event coordinator for various nonprofit organizations. Her extremely high IQ, introverted personality around those her own age, and academic focus prevent her from connecting with young men and women her age.
Panic that she'll be late and disoriented from the unexpected kiss, she ran off without giving Evan her name or number.
A week later, Evan finally finds Sarah. He returns the glasses she left behind when she ran off after the kiss. He had repaired them himself.
Sarah tries to stay focused on studying while Evan tries to charm his way into a quick break at the food court. Eventually, Sarah cannot resist Evan's charm and attraction to him. She agrees to take a break.
At the food court., Sarah begins to question herself. She sees how popular Evan is, especially with the female coeds, and how opposite he is from her. She escaped the food court and headed to her car.
Evan chases her down and breaks her will. They agreed to a date and enjoyed another passionate kiss before she got in her car to head back to her apartment.
Having not dated since she was 16 and knowing little about what typical college girls would wear to a first date, and having no friends, Sarah enlists the help of one of the best students in her Business-101 class, Katie Andrews.
The friendly 18-year-old befriends Sarah quickly, and with the help of her friend and professional hairstylist, they do a makeover on Sarah. Already beautiful, they focus more on modernizing her style than her looks. She traded in her glasses for contacts she wore occasionally and added low lights to her long blonde hair. 
While Sarah was in the hair salon, she began to reconsider her decision not to engage in any romantic relationships while in college. In classic Sarah style, she came up with an idea that was more business than romance. If she was going to do this, she was to plan ahead and make sure her decisions were based on rational thinking, not her fluttering heart.
At first, dinner with Evan was like a contract negotiation. She proposed rules and guidelines to ensure they both benefit from the relationship physically and scholastically. She told Evan that her priority was her aspiration to finish at the top of her class.
Evan happily agreed. It was love at first sight, and he liked the idea of starting a relationship with aligned expectations.
With that out of the way, Sarah was more comfortable exposing that small part of her that craves romance and affection and allows vulnerability. A part of her that she didn't even know existed until she kissed Evan.
The date ended with more passionate kissing and a special gift from Evan to memorialize the unique way they met and had their first kiss.
They had a great year together. Sarah opened up more socially, and Evan became a better student with Sarah's help. She even helped him secure a well-paying job in Chicago.
Unbeknownst to Evan, Sarah planned to attend an Ivy League school to get her master's degree. At least, that's what she told herself. But something inside her prevented her from committing to any of the many prestigious universities recruiting her. She and Evan didn't talk about the future. They were enjoying their time together.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan was planning to propose at the graduation party he and Guido were throwing in a party room they rented at a nearby hotel.
Also unbeknownst to Sarah, Evan invited her parents, asking them to keep their visit a secret. The proposal was not the only surprise of the evening. Guido and Evan had purchased a plaque to honor Sarah's achievement of graduating top of her class. Sarah's parents came thinking that was the purpose of their visit.
Sarah had not been entirely forthcoming with details about her relationship with Evan. She let her parents believe that her relationship with Evan was just casual and hid the depth of his feelings for her and her feelings for him.
Sarah feared disappointing her father and thought she could manage her feelings for Evan and stay on course with her life goals.
Evan’s surprise proposal in front of 30 or 40 friends that attended the party shocked Sarah. While every rational cell in her body and brain said no, her lips said yes. She loved Evan and could not find a way to reject his proposal, even though she knew it would mean changing her plan and following him to Chicago.
After seeing her accept Evan’s proposal, her parent exited out the back door of the party room and up to the penthouse suite they had rented for the night.
Sarah played the role of happy fiancé until the party ended, but in the back of her mind, she feared the confrontation she would have with her father. Not because he would be angry with her, anger she could handle. She feared the disappointment she saw on his face and would feel when meeting in person.
She respected her father, and the two of them had the same goal before she started high school. Yet here she is about to break her promise to her father.
Sarah met with her parents in her hotel room when the party was over. Her father gave her two choices, follow Evan to Chicago and build a life with him or stick to the plan and get her Masters’s at a prestigious school before returning to Seattle.
Sarah's father was a stoic but fair man. He did not demand that Sarah brake her engagement with Evan, but if she did get married to Evan, he still expected her to get her Masters’s degree and work with him in Seattle – Evan was welcome to join her.
If Sarah chose not to honor her agreement with her father and instead build a life with Evan in Chicago, he would cut off his financial support to her. He gave her a month to decide.
Sarah knew of Evan’s close bond with Liz, and he wanted to live close to his sister, who lived in a suburb of Chicago, and she also didn't want to get in the way of Evan's excellent job opportunity that he was to start in a few weeks. She couldn’t ask him to wait for her for two years and then go to Seattle. Her choice was simple. Either build a life with Evan in Chicago or give back the ring and return to the original plan.
Her brain said to stick to the plan. Her heart said to build a life with Evan. Against all odds, her heart won.</Notes>

Sequence of Events:
After kissing the woman of his dreams, just to see her bolt into the unknown, Evan saw no point in going into the undergrad library to study. All he could think about was Sarah.
Evan decided to remain near the scene of their first kiss, hoping she would return to retrieve her broken glasses or, even better, return to see him.
This scene has Evan pacing back and forth and anxiously hoping, praying for Sarah to return.
Have Evan walk over to view the Morrow Plots to pass the time, but he never strayed too long for fear he would miss her return.
After an hour with no Sarah to be seen, Evan decided he would fix her glasses and return to the scene of the kiss tomorrow at the same time he first met her.
He hoped that she would have the same plan or that her schedule would be consistent and at the same spot the next day.
Wanting to tell Guido all about his experience with Sarah, Evan walked over to The Quad.
No surprise to Evan; Guido is hitting on two sophomore coeds. When it comes to women, it's a numbers game with Guido. Those two girls were his fifth and sixth attempts of the day.
Evan grabbed Guido by the shirt and pulled him away from the girls. The girls laughed as they continued on their way.
Evan: &quot;I gotta tell you something!&quot;
Guido:  &quot;Hey, Man! Why'd you  do that?&quot; He continued in full bravado. &quot;I had those two in the palm of my hand.&quot;
Of course, Guido did not have the two girls in the palms of his hand. 
Evan: &quot;You did not. Never mind about that. I got something to tell you!&quot;
Guido dons a confused look on his face waiting for Evan to share his news.
Evan: &quot;I just kissed the most beautiful, amazing, wonderful woman in the world!&quot;
A skeptical Guido  replied mildly sarcastically, &quot;Sure you did.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I did, Guido! I am telling you I did.&quot;
Guido: “Where is she? What's her name?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't know. She ran off before I could get her name and number.&quot;
Guido: &quot;You're just fucking with me. You know everyone on campus.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm telling you the truth.&quot; Evan showed Guido Sarah's damaged eyeglasses. &quot;Here's proof. She left these behind. They fell off when we kissed.&quot;
Guido: &quot;That must've been one hell of a kiss!&quot;
Evan: &quot;It was! We kissed before we even spoke one word to each other.&quot; Evan paused and looked at the glasses, &quot;I think I will call her Cinderella. Instead of leaving a glass slipper, she left eyeglasses.&quot;
Guido was surprised. &quot;You kissed a girl Before even getting her name? That's not like you, bro.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I couldn't help it. The Universe dropped her on my lap, and I had to go for it.&quot;
Guido: &quot;What are you gonna do now?&quot;
Evan: &quot;I am going to fix her glasses and try to find her tomorrow. Do you have an eyeglass repair kit?&quot;
Guido looked at Evan like he was nuts and said sarcastically. &quot;Sure, I got one in my back pocket.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I should be able to find one at the mall. You want to come with?&quot;
Guido: &quot;Nah, I see a lonely lady over there that looks like she needs a visit from 'The Guido.’&quot;
The scene ends with Evan headed off toward his car to drive to the mall. Try to find a way to keep the reader as vested as Evan was in anticipation of seeing Sarah the next day.</Text>

            <Text>As Katie was about to open her mouth to dive into another subject, the familiar buzz of her cell phone diverted her attention. She quickly glanced at the screen, her eyebrows arching slightly. &quot;Oh, it's Nicole, my hairstylist,&quot; she explained. &quot;She wants to confirm our appointment and she needs a picture of you to start making a plan for your makeover.&quot;
Sarah blinked in surprise but then smiled in response. &quot;Alright, let's do it.&quot;
Katie quickly captured a picture of Sarah, her fingers flying over the phone as she sent the image to Nicole. Within moments, Nicole responded with a flurry of excited emojis, already expressing her eagerness to work on Sarah's transformation. 
Katie asked, &quot;So altogether, including new clothes and hairstylist, what kind of budget are we talking?&quot; 
&quot;No budget constraints, you're in charge!&quot; Sarah said with a playful grin.
Katie's eyes lit up at this and she squealed, clapping her hands in excitement. &quot;Really? Oh, this is going to be so much fun!&quot;
The energy in the room was effervescent, reflecting off Sarah as her own excitement began to bubble up. It was new, this anticipation of a date, of being made over, of possibly breaking her own rules, but it was an invigorating feeling that Sarah welcomed.</Text>

            <Title>Tamora Pierce</Title>
            <Text>In the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the lives of two seniors, Sarah Wilkins and Evan Vaughn, unfolded with divergent rhythms. 
Evan was a heart-throb, his athletic physique and charisma making him a beloved figure. Raised by his gentle-hearted sister Liz, he had learned to treat everyone with respect, whether they were a high-profile football captain or a humble water boy. But his academic skills didn't mirror his athletic prowess. He held no love for stuffy classrooms, preferring the call of the wild outdoors. But he'd promised Liz he'd aim for a GPA of 3.0 and he intended to keep his word. Hence, he turned his back on the free-spirited games with his friend Guido, immersing himself in study at the undergraduate library.
Sarah, conversely, was an academic luminary, her eyes set firmly on graduating as the class valedictorian. The library was her fortress, where she lost herself in intricate audio seminars and prepared for her teaching assistant role in a Business-101 class. A future CEO of her father's corporation, she had sworn off any romantic entanglements until she had her Master's degree in hand.
Destiny decided to interweave their lives when an engrossed Sarah, oblivious to her surroundings, nearly took a tumble down a wide flight of steps. Evan's quick reflexes saved the day, as he swept her up in a twirling dance move that culminated in a fiery, unexpected kiss. Flustered, Sarah fled, leaving her glasses behind.
Days later, Evan tracked her down, the repaired glasses meant as a charming gesture. In spite of her initial resistance, Sarah found herself yielding to his charm, and they agreed to meet in the food court. There, witnessing Evan's popularity, she doubted herself and the feasibility of their bond, leading her to flee again. Evan, however, wasn't one to be easily discouraged, and following another electrifying kiss, they agreed on a date.
In a twist of events, Sarah found herself relying on Katie Andrews, an earnest student from her class, to help her prepare for the date. With a modernized makeover, Sarah started reassessing her rigid resolution against college romances. If she was to step into this whirlwind, it would be with a well-laid plan, ensuring her academics wouldn't suffer.
Evan agreed to her terms. Ever since their first kiss, he'd been smitten, and now, they officially began their journey as a couple. Sarah slowly allowed herself to explore her dormant romantic side, while Evan improved academically under her guidance. Yet, while they relished the present, the future was a book unopened, Sarah undecided about attending an Ivy League school, and Evan, unbeknownst to her, planning a surprise proposal.
At their graduation party, Evan's proposal caught Sarah off-guard. Though her pragmatic side hesitated, her heart responded with a 'yes.' But her fears of disappointing her father, whom she had misled about the intensity of her relationship with Evan, lingered.
Her father presented her with a choice: follow Evan to Chicago while pursuing her Master's, or adhere to her initial plan. The repercussions of choosing Evan and a life in Chicago would result in the cessation of his financial aid. 
Now, Sarah was caught in a dilemma. She was aware of Evan's loyalty towards his sister and his potential job in Chicago, and she was unwilling to put her needs before his. Thus, she was left with a difficult decision: follow the path she had meticulously planned or give in to the unpredictable call of love. And when the time came, Sarah chose Evan, her heart finally outweighing her calculated judgments.</Text>

Joe: Normally even-keeled in situations like this, Joe was acting a bit nervous. The reason for this was that he planned to have Liz open the last gift of the morning, an engagement ring. He planned to propose to Liz that day.
Evan: Similar to Liz, Evan prioritized family. However, his excitement was more akin to a child opening presents on Christmas. Having Sarah by his side for such a special holiday added to his excitement.
Sarah: Sarah remained neutral. She wore a pleasant smile but never was one to celebrate the holidays with deep emotion. Sarah's Christmas day traditions were more on the cerebral side. Regardless of how much money her parents had or didn't have, she was always given only one gift. Her father wanted her to understand that she must work for the things she wanted.

It showed the excitement and approval from Evan regarding Liz's engagement to Joe.
It also depicted that as much as Evan had opened up Sarah's emotional side, she felt awkward at moments like this. While everyone else was filled with joy and excitement, Sarah merely played the part. She said the right words and smiled the way she should have. But inside her was still a lifetime of resistance to emotional reactions.
Evidenced by Evan's first semester grades, Sarah has had a positive impact on Evan's academic achievements.

Much to Liz's delight, the Chicago area was graced with a foot of snow overnight. By the time Christmas morning unveiled itself, the heavy snowfall had softened, giving way to gentle flurries that danced outside their apartment, painting a serene and romantic landscape befitting a holiday filled with love and warmth.

            <Title>Part 2: Katie can use the room</Title>
            <Text>
&quot;Wow, this place is amazing! How many bedrooms are there?&quot; The question resonated in the expansive space.
&quot;Two.&quot; Sarah's response came as a quiet murmur.
&quot;Is your roommate home?&quot; Katie inquired, her visual exploration of the apartment ongoing.
Sarah negated with a shake of her head. &quot;It’s just me. My father insisted I have an extra bedroom that I could use as an office. But I never use the guest room, I prefer to  work at the dining room table where I can spread out, or in my bedroom before I go to sleep.&quot;
The idea of privacy, the luxury of space, left Katie yearning. &quot;I can’t even imagine what it’s like not to have to share a room. Living in a tiny dorm room with a chatty roommate, makes it impossible to study.&quot;
An understanding hovered between them, thick and unspoken. As Katie's gaze made another sweep across the grand expanse of the apartment, Sarah seized the moment. With the effusive warmth of a mother granting her child a long-cherished wish, she said, &quot;You know, the guest room's always open if you ever need a quiet study sanctuary!&quot;
“Really! Thank you!&quot; With those words, Katie lunged forward and gave Sarah a big hug, the latter taken by surprise but welcoming the warmth.</Text>

            <Title>0208 The Post-Game Party</Title>
            <Synopsis>After the Enforcers win their game, Sarah joins Evan, Guido, and a dozen friends to celebrate at Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill. Despite the group's excitement, Sarah feels like an outcast. Her struggle reflects her commitment to support Evan and her discomfort due to her inability to connect socially with peers.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah and Evan entered Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill, immediately embraced by the lively energy of sports enthusiasts and the tantalizing aroma of a backyard barbeque. Memorabilia adorned the walls, flat-screen TVs displayed various games, and the gleaming bar beckoned with its wide selection of drinks. Evan's eyes sparkled with excitement as he gave the host Guido's name, and they were seated at a reserved table made of polished wood.
As they settled in, friends began to trickle in, their faces glowing with pride and joy. High-fives, hugs, and handshakes were exchanged. Shout-outs went to Evan for scoring the winning run in the Enforcers' latest win.
Sarah forced a smile, trying to engage, but felt like an outsider. No one spoke to her. She glanced at the door, secretly hoping Patti would walk through, her one connection in this crowd. But Patti was a no-show.
Where's Patti? She's the only one who talks to me.
The thought was interrupted by the larger-than-life entrance of Guido, who threw open his arms with flair and announced, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, your hero, the Guido, has arrived! Now we can kick this lame party into high gear!&quot; His voice rose above the din, his posture full of triumph and self-assurance.
Laughter and chatter escalated, the group reveling in the victory. The TV screens flashed with highlights, the faces of famous athletes watching over them, their successes immortalized on the walls.
But for Sarah, the laughter felt alienating, the noise overwhelming. She looked at Evan, so natural in this environment, so happy and proud. But she felt alone, disconnected.
&quot;Hey, where's Patti?&quot; Evan asked Roxanne, puzzled by her absence, as he always saw her and Roxanne together at gatherings like this.
Roxanne's eyes flickered to Sarah, a pointed glare in them, filled with unspoken blame. &quot;She wasn't feeling well,&quot; she said, her voice cool, letting the words hang in the air. Her gaze lingered on Sarah a moment longer, ensuring her message was delivered without saying it outright. The unspoken message was clear to Sarah, though Evan remained oblivious.
Sarah's heart sank. She had hoped that Patti might be her saving grace for the evening. She couldn't understand Roxanne's passive-aggressive glare implying it was Sarah's fault that Patti didn't show.
With no hope of a friendly face other than Evan's, Sarah picked at her food, the taste of the hearty bar fare lost on her, the vibrant setting fading into a blur.
The celebration continued, friends engaging with the memorabilia, commenting on the games, and ensuring beers remained full. Guido was the life of the party, his loud voice filled with enthusiasm.
Sarah's thoughts drifted to her past, her lifelong struggle to connect. Her successes and failures always so clear-cut, so black-and-white. And now, at this moment, she felt like a failure. Maybe I shouldn't have broken my number one rule. I could be home right now, reading, studying, and stress-free.
She leaned over to Evan, her voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Can we please leave?&quot;
They left shortly after dinner, Evan making excuses about studying, protecting Sarah from his friends' disappointment. His friends teased and tried to persuade him, but Evan stuck to his decision to leave.
During the walk to the car, Sarah's emotions were in turmoil. She asked Evan to drive, holding back tears, refusing to cry from emotional duress.
&quot;It's not unusual for someone new to the group to be less talkative. Happens all the time.&quot; Evan reassured her, his voice gentle.
Upon arriving at Evan's apartment parking lot, Sarah exited the car and headed to the driver's side. Evan's warm, reassuring kiss, delivered just before she sat in the driver's seat, provided a momentary balm to her inner turmoil. But the lingering distress was far from resolved. She pretended to feel better, forcing a smile as she drove away, leaving Evan at his apartment. As she headed home, the silence in the car became a heavy burden, amplifying her mind's doubt and self-reproach. Her earlier feelings of isolation and failure were now her sole companions on the journey.
Did I make a mistake with Evan? Maybe I shouldn't have entered this relationship with Evan. What was I thinking?
The questions lingered as she drove on, the lively atmosphere of Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill a distant memory, her struggle to connect a present reality.</Text>
            <Notes>Roxanne still critical of Sarah.
Patti is sad and resigned to the fact that she and Evan will not be reigniting the intimate aspects of their relationship.</Notes>

Family background: 
Sarah Wilkins, an only child, was a beacon of exceptionalism, born and bred for success. Raised in a household where playdates and frivolous activities were forsaken for the grandeur of academia, Sarah found herself immersed in an ocean of knowledge from an early age. Her childhood revolved around devouring non-fiction educational books, her imagination flickering not with tales of adventure but with the enlightening prose of fact and theory.
Her parents, particularly her domineering father, were the rudder that steered the ship of her life. The University of Illinois, her father’s alma mater, became Sarah’s undergraduate choice despite being capable of securing a scholarship to any institution across the country. Even with the allure of prestigious Ivy League schools for her postgraduate studies, the sense of legacy and deference to her father’s wishes guided her decision.
Sarah’s relationship with her father was less traditional and more of a mentorship, a catalyst that stimulated her thirst for learning. Their household, punctuated by an omnipresent stoicism, eschewed affection for mutual respect. Hugs were a rarity, with personal growth and intellectual achievement held on a higher pedestal.
Sarah was a paragon of her parents’ molding, embracing the rigorous standards they set for her. Her extraordinarily high IQ melded seamlessly with their crafted path, creating an academic prodigy poised for greatness. Valedictorian of her high school, she graduated college with the same top honors, her formidable pre-college resume testament to her commitment and prowess.
In the whirlwind of academia, Sarah found herself baffled by the incessant chatter of girls concerning boys. While she wasn’t entirely immune to the fluttering feelings of attraction, dating was more of an anthropological study for her. She wanted to decipher the energy and time girls dedicated to boys, a concept alien to her own mindset.
As she transitioned to college, Sarah made a pact with herself: no dalliances, no romantic distractions. Her goal was singular - acquire her master’s degree, and lay the foundation for a successful professional life. It was a pledge set in stone, the echo of her parents’ teachings resonating within her, guiding her toward the brilliance they had prepared her for.
Relationship history:  
In high school, Sarah experimented briefly with boys. She wasn’t a virgin when she started college but had minimal experience compared to other females her age.
Before meeting Evan, she honored her commitment to avoiding all romantic entanglements in college.
Health History: 
Sarah was meticulous regarding self-care. Her dietary habits would impress the strictest of nutritionists. She was religious in her exercise routine, combining time indoors at the gym and jogging and biking outdoors.
Interestingly, Sarah’s motivation to keep healthy and fit had little to do with vanity or lifespan. Instead, she always wants to look presentable and confident in business meetings, negotiations, and social events from philanthropic endeavors and business ventures.
Future Outlook:
Aspirations/Dreams: 
Her primary dream is to expand her father’s corporation internationally and eventually take over her father’s role as CEO. Of secondary importance, she would like to be married and have a child to raise like she was raised. However, she would only want a child if it didn’t interfere with her professional aspirations.
Primary Goal: Sarah’s ultimate goal was to replace her father as CEO of his multi-million dollar corporation.  
How does the character handle stress or crises? 
Sarah is as stoic as they come. She is calm under pressure. Her high IQ and business brilliance often lead to quickly resolving any crisis.
What motivates this character? 
Even before Sarah began her high school journey, her path forward was as clear as a sunlit highway. She would be the valedictorian of her graduating class – this wasn’t a possibility; it was an expectation. Such was the certainty of her brilliance and the weight of the destiny she felt she had been handed down.
The University of Illinois was the stepping stone, a nod to her father’s legacy. Once there, she intended to dominate the academic charts, rising as cream does to the top. Her sights, though, were firmly set on the gleaming towers of the Ivy League for her master’s degree, an ambition as naturally conceived as a sunflower turning towards the sun.
College was not just about academics for Sarah. It was an opportunity to broaden her connections and foster relationships within circles of influence and wealth. While rooted in a sincere desire to make a difference, her philanthropic endeavors also served the dual purpose of positioning her within networks of power. Every charity event attended and fundraiser led, they were stepping stones to fulfilling her destiny.
Key Conflict: 
Sarah’s heart was entangled in a fierce battle between her love for Evan and her father’s carefully crafted life plan for her. On the one hand, there was Evan, the man who had ignited her soul and shown her a world of love and emotional depth she had never known. He challenged her to embrace vulnerability and live for the moment, beckoning her to break free from the rigid confines of her predestined path.
On the other hand, there was her father, the respected figure whose expectations had guided her every step. The thought of disappointing him weighed heavily on her, as she had always strived to be the embodiment of his ambitions and aspirations. But as she stood at this critical crossroad, Sarah knew that whichever choice she made, an important man in her life would be left disheartened. The weight of the decision pressed upon her like a relentless storm, and she yearned for a way to reconcile her heart’s desires with the legacy she was meant to fulfill.
How does the character change by the end of the novel? 
Sarah’s role is the protagonist and female love interest. The story revolves around her unexpected romance with Evan. We see throughout the story that she fights her feelings for Evan along the way. But his charm and persistence shatter her resistance. Ultimately, she chooses her love for Evan over her promise to her father. After the elopement, she wonders if she made the best choice.

Character Description:
Sarah Wilkins, a 21-year-old ambitious woman from Seattle, Washington, was an embodiment of both grace and determination. Her tall frame, complemented by a wave-kissed blonde mane and steely gray-blue eyes, seemed to reflect her dual nature. Outwardly sophisticated and distant, she drove her pearl white Audi luxury sedan through the streets of Champaign, Illinois, where she was completing her senior year at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Business.
With a high IQ, her parents’ expectations, and a fierce drive, she had excelled academically. But beyond the intelligence and the straight A’s lay a complex personality. She was branded a Ruler in terms of brand archetypes and an ISTJ in the Myers-Briggs framework. Her strengths were numerous, from her intelligence and sophistication to her generosity, hard work, and responsibility. Yet, she had her weaknesses too. People often found her cold, distant, and unapproachable, misreading her analytical mind as condescension.
Sarah’s life was consumed by her career aspirations, working tirelessly as a volunteer for nonprofit organizations and interning for large corporations in the summer. Her wardrobe, replete with designer dresses, skirt suits, and even designer casual wear, spoke of a woman who understood the value of appearance in business.
Despite her business brilliance, she harbored fears. She feared romantic entanglements could sabotage her professional aspirations, and she feared her emotions might one day hinder her decisions. But love did find her in Evan, the man who nicknamed her Cinderella, a name that would encapsulate their fairytale love story.
Her background was one of privilege and rigor. Raised in a household that emphasized intellectual growth over emotional connection, Sarah was molded to achieve greatness, a path that led her to follow her father’s legacy to the University of Illinois.
Yet, by the end of the novel, love had changed her. The rigid boundaries of her predestined path had been broken, and she chose love over legacy, reflecting a transformation that revealed her vulnerability, passion, and the depth of her humanity.

Hobbies: These activities are recreational and are likely pursued for enjoyment and personal fulfillment. Playing softball and watching baseball games would certainly fall into the category of hobbies, as they're often associated with leisure and entertainment.
Habits: If Evan engages in these activities regularly and they become a routine part of his life, they could also be classified as habits. Working out at the gym, in particular, could be seen as a habit if it's a consistent part of his daily or weekly routine</Notes>

            <Text>Continuing Evan's Profile, Part 2:
Character Profile: Evan Vaughn
What were Evan's romantic relationships like in college prior to meeting Sarah?
Although Evan doesn't perceive himself as a hopeless romantic, that is who he is. In order to love a woman romantically, he must feel that special chemistry with the woman that cannot be manufactured or faked.
However, Evan doesn't like to be alone, so he still has relationships while he waits for that special connection. Before meeting Sarah, he had never experienced that special chemical connection with anyone else.
Others would describe Evan as having a handful of girlfriends during college before meeting Sarah. However, he never considered the women that he went out with as girlfriends.
If he took a particular liking to a college coed but was not in love with her, he would start paying more attention to her. This special attention often misled these women into thinking he was their boyfriend. Because of Evan's vow to never even date two women at a time, when he would enter into an intimate relationship with the woman he liked but didn't love, he considered that relationship as friends with benefits. However, to the woman, she thought Evan was now her boyfriend.
After a few months in one of these relationships, Evan starts to pull out of the relationship and inadvertently breaks the woman's heart. However, it was college, and relationships were more casual then. So, it was never an overly dramatic situation.
Women just assumed that Evan had a fear of commitment. That wasn't true at all. Evan craved being in a committed relationship, but only if he was madly in love with his partner.
When he met Sarah, all the pieces fell into place for Evan. He fell immediately in love and was more than ready to commit to a relationship and call her his girlfriend. 
So, while others would've considered Sarah his sixth or seven girlfriend during college, Evan considered Sarah his first girlfriend and, ultimately, his first love.
It's important to note, that while Evan attracted the most beautiful women on campus, beauty was not his top priority when it came to his attraction to women. For Evan, attraction was about personality and chemistry.
Is Evan an introvert or an extrovert?
To label Evan as either an introvert or an extrovert would be a mistake. When suffering emotional duress, his propensity to withdraw might make him appear as an introvert, but that wasn't his typical state of being.
On the other hand, because of his popularity, affinity for meeting new people, and befriending others, he might be considered an extrovert. But this wasn't the case.
Evan preferred to avoid drawing attention to himself. He wasn't popular by conscious choice, but his good looks and warm personality made him popular. Whether someone were the star quarterback or the worst student in college, Evan would treat everyone kindly.
While Evan did not embrace his popularity, he humbly accepted the situation, never becoming arrogant or allowing it to inflate his ego.
Character Arc: 
Beginning: Evan starts his journey as a charismatic and physically fit young man. Despite his good looks and affable nature, he struggles with a tendency to shut down and withdraw during times of personal crisis. While he enjoys casual relationships, he yearns for something more profound, a connection that eludes him due to his internal struggles. 
Middle: The turning point in Evan's life comes with the meeting of Sarah. Through their relationship, he experiences a profound sense of love and commitment. Her presence in his life leads him to become more academically and altruistically engaged, nurturing his desire to help others. However, his tendency to withdraw during challenging times remains a shadow that affects his relationship with Sarah and others. 
End: Evan's transformation throughout the story is marked by an increased awareness of his flaws and a concerted effort to grow. Yet, the tendency to shut down during personal  crises persists, adding layers of complexity to his character. His engagement and marriage to Sarah symbolize a commitment to love, but his personal growth is imperfect, leaving room for ongoing challenges in his relationships and personal life..
Character Description:
Evan Vaughn is the epitome of a romantic novel's male protagonist. Evan's appearance is undeniably handsome. Standing at 6'2&quot; and weighing 200 pounds, his lean, muscular physique is sculpted like a professional athlete, and his clean-cut medium-brown hair and hazel eyes complete the captivating look.
Evan's wardrobe effortlessly balances casual and formal styles, allowing him to switch from laid-back jeans and T-shirts to smart slacks and suits, all with a touch that remains true to his style. As a personal trainer, he is passionate about fitness, engaging in various physical activities like hiking, running, biking, and weight training.
Loyal, respectful, romantic, and polite, Evan's personality reflects the archetype of a Hero. He's non-confrontational and known for fidelity in relationships, a true symbol of integrity and trust. However, his unwillingness to forgive his father and the trauma from his past occasionally cause him to withdraw or shut down, leading to complex internal conflicts.
A co-protagonist and the male love interest in the story, Evan's life takes a meaningful turn when he meets Sarah, his love interest. His relationships with his best friend Guido, his older sister Liz, and his other friends also play a crucial role in his life.
Evan's journey is marked by personal growth, embracing love, and committing to a path that aligns with his values and dreams. He's a character who symbolizes the power of transformation through love, forgiveness, and personal understanding.</Text>

Scene Name: Evan And Sarah Kiss
Summary: Evan spots Sarah, a stranger to him, oblivious and headed toward concrete steps. Realizing the impending danger, he sprints to her rescue, preventing a perilous fall. In the chaos of the moment, their lips meet, and they share an unexpected, electrifying kiss.
Characters: Sarah, Evan
POV: Third person limited, from Sarah’s perspective 
Location: Outside of the Undergrad Library
Tone: Frantic, Funny, Romantic, Exciting
Special Instructions: 
Focus on Evan's inner thoughts and feelings during item #14. 
Item #6 Is meant to have a humorous tone. You don't have to force the humor, the reader can probably sense it from the dialogue.
In item #6, Evan uses the word &quot;lady&quot; because, at a distance, he mistook Sarah for a teacher. Sarah intentionally wore skirt suits and her hair up in a bun with her glasses when she taught her class. She wanted to appear as a professor instead of a college coed.
In item #12, inform the reader that when Sarah is Brett thought of her hair, and her glasses fell away from her face, Evan could see that she was a student, not a professor.
In Item #14, have Evan pull Sarah close so he can kiss her.
Weather: Sunny, comfortable temperature, perfect day
1.	The scene starts with Sarah emerging from the library with her earbuds in her ears. Use the location profile of &quot;Outside of the Undergrad Library&quot; to describe the area outside the library doors.
2.	Her pace was fast because she was in a bit of a panic about being late for class.
3.	Her mind was preoccupied with concerns about tardiness and the voice coming through her earbuds.
4.	Evan had never met Sarah. 
5.	He saw she was not paying attention and was only a few feet away from the concrete stairs with no railing.
6.	He called out to warn her. He shouted, “Hey, lady in the skirt suit!&quot; Everyone heard him except the lady in the skirt suit.
7.	He didn't know if he could make it, but he took off at high speed to try and stop her before she fell on the concrete stairs with no railing.
8.	He caught her just in time, but the momentum of her fast pace caused her body to swing around as if they were dancing and he was dipping her.
9.	Her briefcase, purse, and their contents flew in all directions. Her eyeglasses fell to the ground.
11. The barrette that loosely held her hair in an updo fell out, causing her long hair to barely touch the ground as she fell backward.
12.	She found herself leaning back almost parallel to the ground.
13.	They gazed longingly at each other. 
14.	Evan told Sarah, &quot;I feel like I should kiss you.&quot; Caught in the moment, Sarah smiled and uncharacteristically said, &quot;I’m not going to stop you.&quot; 
15.	They shared a deep passionate kiss. After the kiss, Evan lifted Sarah back to her feet.
16.	She remembered how late she was and frantically gathered her belongings with Evan's assistance.
17.	Evan asked her her name.
18.	Out of sorts, she responded, &quot;I have to go. I'm late!&quot;
19.	Evan laughed and said, &quot;That's a strange name.&quot;
20.	Sarah was too out of sorts to recognize she brought unintended humor to this romantically charged moment.
21.	She took off without sharing her name or phone number, unknowingly leaving her broken glasses behind. Note: the lenses weren't broken, just the hinge on one of the arms.
22.	Evan picked up her glasses and held them high in the air as he called out to her. Either she didn't hear him, or she didn't want to respond, as she kept running.
23. With Sarah's glasses in hand and a lighthearted grin on his face, Evan watched her disappear into the distance, leaving behind a whirlwind of emotions and a promise of a future encounter he knew was meant to be.

Location Profile:
Name of the place: Sarah's Apartment
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign
Type of place: Apartment
How does the setting affect the characters and the plot? 
Two scenes take place at this location. First is when Katie helps Sarah get ready for her date with Evan. The second is when Sarah returns home from her date with Evan.
Sarah struggles to bond with other college students. However, Katie and Sarah develop a bond at the apartment. Sarah even offers the use of her guest bedroom to Katie when she needs alone time to study.
Description: 
Sarah's apartment is a testament to modern luxury, situated on the top floor of a relatively new six-story student housing complex. The building, less than three years old, exudes a contemporary charm, with its sleek exterior design and high-end amenities.
Her father, ever the generous provider, had secured for her a two-bedroom apartment, one of which she could utilize as an office. However, true to her workaholic nature, Sarah found more comfort working in the same room she slept in. 
Stepping inside the apartment, one is immediately struck by the immaculate cleanliness. The open concept living area is crisply kept, filled with minimalist furniture in subtle hues. Floor-to-ceiling windows line one side of the living room, allowing ample natural light to fill the space while providing breathtaking views of the city below. 
The kitchen area is equally impressive, complete with top-of-the-line stainless steel appliances, a marble countertop, and stylish cabinetry. Despite the well-equipped kitchen, the lack of use indicates Sarah's preference for take-out or on-campus meals over cooking. 
Sarah's bedroom doubles as her workspace, holding a luxurious bed with a stylishly austere frame and an ergonomic desk cluttered with papers, textbooks, and a high-end laptop. The room feels lived in but organized, an oasis of personal space in her otherwise untouched apartment.
The guest bedroom, by contrast, remains pristine and scarcely used. The perfectly made bed, devoid of wrinkles, and the dustless surfaces create an atmosphere of a high-end hotel room, awaiting its first guest. Despite its emptiness, the room is prepared with all the essentials, standing as a silent testament to Sarah's meticulous and organized nature.
Overall, Sarah's apartment reflects her personality – ambitious, detail-oriented, and somewhat reserved, providing a space that's more functional than personal. Despite the apartment's capacity for hosting and socialization, it remains primarily a sanctuary for Sarah, a place of quiet solitude and diligent work.</Text>
            <Notes>Please provide me with a description for Sarah's apartment. Here are some details:
* Sarah's wealthy father paid for Luxury Student Housing.
* She is on the top floor of a six-story building.
* The building is less than three years old.
* Her father got her a two bedroom apartment so that she could have one bedroom as her office.
* Being the workaholic that Sarah is, she just prefers to work in the bedroom she sleeps in.
* Sarah keeps the apartment crisp and clean.
* The guest bedroom looks as though it's never been used.</Notes>

            <Title>0165 Sarah Updates Katie</Title>
            <Synopsis>After a magical first date, Sarah returns to her apartment to share the evening events with Katie. Katie and Sarah are excited to see that Evan has requested that he and Sarah change their Facebook status to “In a Relationship.”</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sarah entered her apartment and closed the door behind her, a mixture of emotions swirling within her like a storm. She leaned back against the door and released a long sigh, feeling as if she were floating on a cloud. The evening's events had left her vibrating with excitement, a sense of relief washing over her like a gentle wave. The experience had been nothing short of exhilarating, leaving her weightless in its wake.
Katie's voice cut through her thoughts, pulling her back to the present. &quot;I am guessing by the look on your face that the date went well?&quot; Her eyes sparkled with a mixture of hope and curiosity.
Sarah's lips curled into a radiant smile as she met Katie's gaze. &quot;It was perfect.&quot;
Katie's own excitement was palpable as she jumped up and down, embracing Sarah in a tight hug. Her voice trembled with genuine happiness as she exclaimed, &quot;I’m so happy for you, Sarah. Come sit down, let’s talk.&quot;
Sarah followed Katie to the couch, settling in as she held out the pendant for her friend to see. &quot;Evan calls me his Cinderella because I’m always trying to run away from him like it’s midnight.&quot;
With a knowing smile, Sarah shared the story behind the necklace, the sentiment and thoughtfulness that Evan had poured into its creation. As she spoke, she felt a tear well up in her eye, the emotions of the moment overwhelming her once again.
Katie's voice was soft as she responded, her eyes shining with empathy and a touch of envy. &quot;Oh, Sarah, that’s so romantic. I swear you are the luckiest woman I know.&quot;
Sarah's heart swelled with joy, her fingers tracing the delicate pendant as she replied, &quot;I feel like the luckiest woman alive.&quot;
A gentle buzz from her phone drew her attention to a Facebook message. She pulled it up to reveal a relationship request from Evan. A mix of nerves and excitement coursed through her as she showed it to Katie.
&quot;Evan wants me to confirm that we’re in a relationship,&quot; she explained.
Katie's question was straightforward, her curiosity evident, but her voice carried a note of seriousness. &quot;Are you in a relationship?&quot;
Sarah's smile spoke volumes as she nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot;
Katie playfully raised an eyebrow, a teasing glint in her eye. &quot;Wow, you move fast! Are you going to confirm it?&quot;
Sarah's response was filled with genuine enthusiasm. &quot;I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to do anything more in my life.&quot;
With a simple tap on the screen, she confirmed the relationship on Facebook, solidifying the connection she had already felt in her heart.
Katie's words were filled with warmth, her face reflecting the affection she felt for her friend as she watched her friend's radiant glow. &quot;I can’t wait for all the details. You are glowing!&quot;
Sarah's laughter was like music, a reflection of the happiness bubbling within her. &quot;I feel incredible, Katie! In a single day, I have an amazing new friend and an amazing new boyfriend. For the first time, I feel like a normal woman.&quot;
As she spoke, a surge of emotion coursed through her, and she couldn't help but thrust back against the cushion in sheer jubilation, her excitement practically tangible.
&quot;Katie, I had no idea it would feel this good.&quot; Her heart soared as she basked in the glow of newfound emotions. Sarah thought, _In the past, I might have scoffed at girls gushing over boys and talking endlessly about romantic feelings. But now, I finally understand. I know what it's like to be kissed romantically, to feel this rush of emotion and connection. And in this moment, I wouldn't trade it for anything.
In that moment, Sarah let go of her rational thoughts, surrendering to the overwhelming surge of feelings that enveloped her. She reveled in the sensation of being a &quot;normal woman,&quot; embracing the intoxicating journey she had embarked upon with Evan.</Text>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

Title: The Post-Game Party
Summary:
After the Enforcers win their game, Sarah joins Evan, Guido, and a dozen friends to celebrate at Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill. Despite the group's excitement, Sarah feels like an outcast. Her struggle reflects her commitment to support Evan and her discomfort due to her inability to connect socially with peers.
Setting:
Location: Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill
Location Description:
Sluggers sports bar and Grill was a bustling hub of activity, alive with the energy of sports enthusiasts and casual diners alike. As soon as you walked through the door, the atmosphere embraced you with the inviting aroma of grilled meats, the clinking of glasses, and the hum of conversation.
The walls were adorned with memorabilia from various sports: framed jerseys, signed baseball bats, vintage football helmets, and photographs of famous athletes in action. A collection of trophies and medals glinted from glass shelves, celebrating local achievements.
Flat-screen TVs were mounted strategically around the bar, each tuned to a different game or sports channel. The bar itself was a handsome wooden structure, polished to a shine and lined with stools where patrons enjoyed their favorite brews. Behind the bar, an array of bottles and taps offered a wide selection of beers, cocktails, and soft drinks, tended by friendly, efficient bartenders.
The dining area was filled with a mix of booths and tables, each topped with a red-and-white checkered tablecloth, providing a cozy and casual feel. The menu was a hearty mix of classic bar fare: burgers, wings, nachos, and salads, all served in generous portions.
A game room at the back of the establishment housed pool tables, dartboards, and arcade games, offering additional entertainment for those looking to engage in friendly competition.
The overall ambiance of the place was one of camaraderie and excitement, a place where friends gathered to enjoy good food, watch the game, and celebrate victories both big and small. The blend of warm lighting, the eclectic sports-themed decor, and the buzz of laughter and cheers created a comfortable and vibrant setting that welcomed everyone, whether a die-hard sports fan or just someone looking for a satisfying meal and a good time.
Time: 1:30 PM
Weather/Environment: Not relevant
Characters Present:
Main Characters: Evan, Sarah
Secondary Characters:  Guido (boisterous, leading the celebration) and a dozen friends (various personalities, all excited about the win)
Character Emotional State:
Evan: Happy, proud, naïve about how Patti will respond to Sarah
Sarah: Outwardly quiet, inside feeling outcast, reflecting on her historical struggle to connect with peers
Guido and Friends: Elated, engaging in lively banter and celebration
POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)
Dialogue Focus: Moderate (mix of lively group chatter and Sarah's minimal responses)
Use of Internal Dialogue: Heavy (focusing on Sarah's emotions, memories, and feelings of inadequacy)
Plot/Action:
Beginning: Sarah and Evan enter the bar. They are the first ones to arrive. Guido called ahead and made the reservation. Evan gives the host Guido's name, and the host seats them.
Middle: Friends trickle in, lively and proud. Most are loud and proud, high-fiving Evan with hugs and handshakes galore. The group is a mixture of college-aged men and women. Some are single, and some are couples.
Eventually and quite intentionally, the loudest of them all, Guido comes in, bragging about the fact that he drove in the winning run.
 Sarah feels like an outcast, no one engages her. 
Unaware of Patti's feelings for Evan or her history with Evan, Sarah secretly hopes she’ll arrive soon and sit beside her. Patti was the one friend that seemed friendly toward her. However, Patti is a no-show. Patti's not ready to be around Evan and Sarah in an environment like this.
Evan asks Roxanne where Patti is. Roxanne glares at Sarah but doesn't disclose Patti's true reason for bailing on the party. While glaring at Sarah, Roxanne said, “She wasn't feeling well.”
Transitions: Sarah's internal dialogue and Evan's engagement with friends bridge the three parts, leading to the eventual decision to leave.
End: Shortly after dinner, the scene ends with Sarah whispering to Evan that she wants to go. Usually, Evan would stay for another two hours enjoying drinks with his friends. He made an excuse, blaming himself for needing to study for a test he wasn't ready for. He didn't want his friends upset that Sarah wanted to leave so early.
Of course, his friends try to convince him to stay. Some teased him. Some tried to persuade him, but all in a fun, friendly way.
Evan stuck with his excuse, and they left the party.
During the walk to the party, Sarah asked Evan if he could drive. She was distraught over her performance at the party. She felt like she had failed. A feeling Sarah was quite unaccustomed to. She wanted to cry, but crying from emotional duress was foreign to Sarah. She was okay shedding happy tears, like tears that flowed when Evan gave her the pendant. But she refused to cry due to her feeling of failure.
Of course, Evan didn't feel like she failed at all. He reassures her that it’s common for someone new to the group to be less talkative the first few times during the get-together.
Ultimately, Sarah drops off Evan at his apartment. Sarah exits the car to move to the driver's seat, but she gets Evan's comforting and reassuring kiss before she drives away. She pretends that she feels better, but her inner dialogue says differently.
The scene should end with her driving home, silently admonishing herself. She begins to question whether she should have violated her no-dating rule and entered a relationship with Evan in the first place.
Objectives/Goals:
This scene shows how much Sarah struggles to connect in a social environment unrelated to a business or nonprofit venture. 
The struggle is made worse by her lifetime inability to connect socially and emotionally with peers of her age.
We also see how Sarah measures herself in a very black-and-white, success or failure way.
Show Sarah's struggle to connect in social environments and how this contrasts with the group's enjoyment. Highlight her black-and-white thinking regarding success or failure.
Props/Items:
Food, Drink, TV’s on the wall (integrated into the scene as characters interact with them).
Dialogue:
Tone: Lively for the group; for Sarah, isolated, outcast, insecure, inadequate
Specific Lines: More emphasis on the game discussion, Guido ensuring that beers remain full, teasing towards Evan, all contrasting with Sarah's quiet responses.
Special Instructions/Notes:
Introductory Description: As previously provided
Integration of Setting: Characters interact with the environment; memorabilia, TV screens, etc., play a role in the scene.
Emphasize Sarah's Perspective: Use deep POV and internal dialogue to highlight her overwhelming feelings.
Contrast in Experience: Emphasize the joy of the group and Sarah's isolation to make the reader feel the overwhelming noise and energy as she does.
Build Transitions: Use dialogue, actions, and internal thoughts to smoothly lead from one part to the next..

            <Notes>Roxanne still critical of Sarah.
Patti is sad and resigned to the fact that she and Evan will not be reigniting the intimate aspects of their relationship.
After Evan's softball team wins a game, Sarah joins him and his lively group of friends, including Guido, for a post-game celebration at a restaurant. The 12-person group, a mix of men and women, is boisterous and excited about the win, engaging in animated conversations about sports and college life. Despite her best efforts to fit in, Sarah feels like a total outcast, mostly remaining silent and retreating into her thoughts. She grapples with her feelings of isolation and her commitment to support Evan's social life, exposing her struggle to balance her own discomfort with her relationship's demands. </Notes>

Scene Name: Waiting Game
Summary: The day following their unexpected kiss, Evan lingered at the very spot, filled with anticipation for Sarah's return. Two hours of hopeful waiting passed with no sight of her. Finally, Guido arrived, pulling Evan away and persuading him to head home, his dreams of another encounter with Sarah left unfulfilled.
Characters: Evan, Guido
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Time of Day: Morning
Locations: Outside the entrance doors to the undergrad library. The area at and around the spot where Evan and Sarah first kissed.
Tone: The scene starts with Evan hopeful. But as the rain began to drizzle down on him, Evan watched hundreds of people come in and out of the library, none of them being Sarah. With no sight of her, he gradually got sadder and sadder.
Guido came to check on him and successfully got Evan to stop torturing himself at that location and head back to their apartment. 
Guido was also able to instill a bit of hope in Evan.
The scene does a full circle when it comes to Tone. The scene starts with hope,  turns to disappointment, sadness, and then despair before returning to a muted version of hope.
Weather: Cloudy, drizzly
Special Instructions: 
Since there is no dialogue in the first part of this scene, focus on Evan's thoughts and feelings as his emotions roller coaster at first before heading down a steep decline until Guido arrived. I really want the reader to suffer along with Evan. Integrating the increasingly gloomy weather and aligning it with his mood deterioration is essential to help the reader visualize Evans suffering.
Although Guido was not considered a nurturing or compassionate human being, I would like the reader to see he does have a caring side, even if his method of expressing that care is not typical of what others might do.
Even though Guido doesn't really understand why Evan is so distressed, he wanted to be there for his best friend in whatever way he could. 
The dialogue and narratives I have provided may be used as is or changed at your discretion.
Understanding the precise spot where Evan and Sarah had their first kiss is essential. The kiss happened outside in an open, uncovered area on four concrete stairs leading downward from a flat platform. Evan had saved her from a fall, leading to a passionate kiss. The actual spot where they kissed was at least 30 feet from the library entrance.
In the scene, I don't want the reader to think that Evan is stood right in front of the library doors watching people come and go. In his 2-hour wait, Evan shifts from place to place but never gets too close to the kissing spot or the library entry and exit doors. He is always at least 20 are 30 feet away. I don't want the reader to think Evan is overly pathetic or so desperate that he must stand just 2 feet from the kissing spot or the library entrance doors.
This scene takes place on a Friday, the day after the kiss, at the same time as the kiss.
Sequence of Events:
Evan returned to the location where he and Sarah first kissed. He was feeling hopeful, but his hope was diminished a bit, still feeling the disappointment from her not returning to this spot the day before. 
His excitement with yo-yo every time he caught a glimpse of blonde hair or a tall feminine silhouette in his periphery. Every time the door to the undergrad library opened, his heart would skip a beat, thinking it would be her. But she was nowhere to be found.
As time rolled by, the rain rolled in. It started drizzling about half an hour into his wait and continually worsened for another 90 minutes. Evan was worried that if she didn't show, he would have to wait an entire weekend to try again. He knew that weekend would feel like an eternity.
Evan had a jacket on but didn't think to bring an umbrella. He did his best to find trees and awnings to stand under to help keep him dry. But he refused to pick any spot that didn't give him a direct view of the library doors and the place where he and Sarah first kissed—his effort to remain dry produced minimal results.
After Evan had been there a couple of hours, Guido came to check on him.
Guido: &quot;No Luck?”
Evan looked dejected. With his head down, he said, &quot;No, I haven't seen her.&quot;
Guido provided his version of consolation, &quot;Sorry, bro. Don't stress it. There are plenty of fish in the sea.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I don't want to fish in the sea. She's the only one for me.&quot;
Guido: &quot;I don't get you, bro. You got women lined up to be with you, and you're stressing over a girl whose name you don't know? You should adopt my style – no strings attached, no drama.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Yeah, and no hope for love.&quot;
In a way, Guido admired Evan. Guido chuckled. &quot;My friend, ever the hopeless romantic.&quot;
Evan: &quot;I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm just... I'm just...just…&quot; Evan couldn't find the words to express his sentiment. Frustrated, he said, &quot;I don't know what I am. I just know that I have to see my Cinderella again.&quot;
Guido felt for Evan. Guido joked. &quot;Let's leave the matching glass slipper search for another day. Come on, let's head back to our place. We’ll knock down a few beers and watch baseball. The Cubs actually have a chance for the playoffs this year!&quot;
Evan remained silent but didn't appear ready to go with Guido.
Guido gently persisted. &quot;You'll feel a lot better with a cold brew in your hand and a Cubs victory on the TV. I’ll tell you what, after the game, we’ll try to figure a way to get her name.&quot;
Evan, still silent, was not yet persuaded.
Guido joked, &quot;How hard can it be to find the most beautiful girl on campus?&quot;
Guido's words brought a small smile to Evan's face. 
 Evan: &quot;I suppose you're right. I'll bump into her sooner or later.&quot;
Guido: &quot;Exactly! Let's chill at home, and we’ll scour the Internet when the game ends.&quot;
Evan: &quot;Thanks, dude. I feel better already.&quot;
Nothing more was said as they headed home. The scene ends here. I want the reader to feel Evan's contrasting motions of disappointment that he didn't see Sarah and hope that inevitably he'll find his way to her.&quot;

Location Profile:
Name of the place: Shear Elegance
Country: USA
State: Illinois
City: Champaign
Type of place: Hair salon
What role does this setting play in the story? 
This venue is the chic salon where Sarah undergoes a contemporary hair transformation. Even though Sarah's hair is already gorgeous, Nicole, the expert hairstylist, opts to infuse it with subtle lowlights, adding depth to her light blonde locks. Simultaneously, she trims a few inches off, maintaining the hair's overall length but refreshing its look.
In the midst of this protracted styling session, the salon evolves into a space of revelation and burgeoning anticipation. The intimate atmosphere, punctuated by the hum of hairdryers and the gentle clatter of hairstyling tools, lends itself to confessions about Sarah's somewhat sparse romantic past. The air practically thrums with a sense of expectation as Sarah contemplates violating her self-imposed dating moratorium and potentially embarking on a relationship with Evan.
Description: 
Tucked away in the heart of a vibrant central Illinois lies an unassuming, yet undeniably modern hair salon. Through the large glass facade, the salon's chic and bustling atmosphere beckons to both casual passersby and dedicated customers alike.
Upon crossing the threshold, visitors are met with an airy, open space, replete with the gentle hum of hairdryers, the soft rustle of foil, and the low murmur of friendly conversation. The flooring is a modern marvel, laid out with sleek, polished wooden planks that lend a warm, contemporary touch to the space.
To the right of the entrance, an intimate seating area is neatly arranged. An elegant, tufted couch in a muted gray is flanked by a pair of sleek armchairs. Placed strategically, this area allows Katie to comfortably observe the transformation process from her seat, keeping a watchful eye on Sarah as Nicole works her magic.
Running parallel to the left wall are several state-of-the-art hairstyling stations. Each boasts a large, backlit mirror framed by brushed steel, and a swivel chair upholstered in rich, black leather. Mobile carts filled with an array of high-end hair care products and advanced tools are stationed conveniently next to each chair.
Nicole tends to Sarah at the third station from the entrance, providing a perfect line of sight to Katie from the reflective mirror. The overall lighting is artfully designed to cast an inviting glow over the area, highlighting the natural finishes of the wooden floor and the sophisticated furnishings.
Adding a touch of biophilia, strategically placed potted plants bring a sense of calm and vitality to the salon. The back wall serves as a stylish product display, with lit glass shelves housing an impressive range of premium hair care products and styling tools.
Tucked in the back corner of the salon, a glass partition subtly separates the wash station from the main area. Here, plush, reclining chairs face ceramic sinks, each equipped with modern showerheads, providing a comfortable and relaxing hair-washing experience for clients.
With its soft background music and contemporary aesthetic, this small-town salon rivals its big-city counterparts, promising clients not just a hairstyling appointment, but a luxury experience that caters to their modern tastes.</Text>
