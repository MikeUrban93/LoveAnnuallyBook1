        <Text>Scene: Liz Prepares Christmas Eve Dinner

Part 1: Beginning of the Scene

Plot/Action:

[ The last scene ended in a cliffhanger with the door opening unexpectedly in front of Sarah, and she had horror in her eyes with what she saw. We are going to leave the reader hanging a little bit, as this scene happens in synchronization with Evan and Sarah's drive to Liz's house. Normally when I introduce new characters, start with a narrative about the characters and the new location/setting. But it helps not to confuse the readers who are expecting an instant resolution to the previous cliffhanger scene, and get a jump into the action first, and then direct you provide a narrative. Note: This scene and precisely where the last scene ended in a convergence of paths. ]
A melody of later Christmas songs was playing in the background. Liz loved hosting parties of any size, but preferred intimate family gatherings around the holidays. She was rinsing off the vegetables in the sink when Joe came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her, kissing her gently on the neck.
Joe (warm loving tone): “Did I ever tell you you're the most beautiful woman in the world?”
Liz: “Yes, you have, plenty of times. But I never got tired of hearing it.”
Joe: “Can I have a kiss?”
Liz turned to face Joe, a teasing look on her face.
Liz (playful teasing): “Are you going to tell me who our mystery guest is tonight?”
Joe: “Nope! You're just going to have to wait like everyone else.”
Liz: “Well then you're just going to have to wait for your kiss.”
Liz kissed Joe on the tip of the nose and turned around to return to her meal prep. Joe playfully tickled her, turned her around, and playfully begged her for a kiss.
Liz: “All right, just one quick one.”
Liz was in charge of cooking all of the sides, desserts, and the dinner salad. Joe was in charge of grilling the oversized turkey in his large Weber charcoal grill on the balcony of their second-floor apartment.
Liz: “How is the turkey coming along?”
Joe: “It should be ready in a bout an hour. I thought Evan would be here by now. Have you heard from him?”
Liz pulled out her phone to show Joe some pictures that Evan had just sent of houses from the detour Sarah and he made to a neighborhood famous for its Christmas decorations.
Liz (showing Joe the pictures): “He and Sarah took a detour to that neighborhood they call Candy Cane Lane. He said they were just there and they should be here in about 15 minutes.”
Liz told Joe that she was running behind and either to pick up a knife and start chopping vegetables or to go check on the turkey and watch his basketball game. Joe chose to watch turkey duty and basketball. He grabbed a carrot on his way out. Liz playfully smacked his hand.
[ By telling the reader that Evan was just leaving Candy Cane Lane, the reader can surmise that this scene is happening simultaneously and hopefully anticipate that the cliffhanger will conclude at the end of the scene - which it does.]

        <Text>At the heart of the warm, inviting dining room was a large wooden table, surrounded by six chairs. Sarah sat next to Evan, who was to her right. Across from Evan, another chair sat empty, but with no place setting to suggest it would be filled. At the opposite ends of the table, Liz was closest to Sarah while Joe sat near Evan. Directly across from Sarah, an empty chair awaited the arrival of a mystery guest. *So we’ll be five*, Sarah surmised, quickly calculating the seating arrangement in her mind. 
Like clockwork, the trio set into motion. With the turkey ready to be carved, Evan, Sarah, and Joe flowed through the small kitchen with a graceful efficiency. Sarah was amazed at how they navigated the space without a single collision. There was no dialogue, no verbal cues, yet everyone seemed to know their tasks by heart.
Joe was the first to break away, carving knife and large fork in hand, as Evan and Sarah carried bowls of sides to the table. Salad was portioned, wine was poured, and soon enough, Evan and Liz were seated. Joe continued to slice the turkey, and Liz began distributing the carved pieces.
Evan grabbed the bowl of mashed potatoes and passed it to Sarah, who in turn handed it to Liz. Joe’s plate was filled last, by Liz, while he focused on carving enough turkey for everyone to have at least two servings. He then tucked the turkey back into the oven, set on low, to ensure that their late-arriving guest would enjoy a warm meal
After the raw, heartfelt bonding moment she shared with Liz moments ago, something shifted within Sarah almost imperceptibly. It was as if an internal switch had been flicked, automatically activating her years of etiquette training. Her spine stiffened, movements became deliberate, a veneer of politeness settling over her like a well-tailored coat. Composure, poise, always polite, whispered the voices of countless etiquette lessons. It was a quick, almost reflexive retreat into her more familiar, rigid self, a sanctuary built over years to ward off vulnerability. She looked on at Evan’s family’s warm interactions and, for a moment, realized how much effort it took to defy her own ingrained instincts.
As everyone began to eat, Joe’s phone buzzed. “Our mystery guest will be here soon,” he announced, smiling as he put the phone down. “Any guesses?”
Liz touched her chin thoughtfully. “Hmm. I honestly have no idea. Did you meet some famous Chicago bear player on some remodel of his home?”
“Nope! Better than that,” Joe grinned.
Evan looked shocked. “Better than a Chicago bear joining us for Christmas Eve dinner!? Did you meet my favorite Chicago Cubs pitcher, Lefty Loogan? You would be my hero for life if you invited him for dinner.”
Joe reveled in the suspense. “Nope! You’re gonna like this guest even better than Lefty Loogan.”
Evan’s eyes sparkled mischievously. “Wait a minute. I know it is. It’s Liz’s favorite actor Harvey Hunksman.”
Liz threw a dinner roll at Evan, feigning indignation. “I don’t have a favorite actor. But if I did it certainly wouldn’t be anyone named Harvey Hunksman.”
Evan caught the roll effortlessly and took a bite, grinning. Sarah watched the spectacle, initially horrified at the casual food warfare. But their genuine joy quickly dissipated her discomfort. She found herself leaning into the scene, no longer wishing to escape it. 
*Oh my, how I have changed,* she mused.
Joe, sensing Sarah’s hesitance, sought to include her. “I know you’re new here, but you have any guesses?”
“I don’t really know many people that the three of you collectively know,” Sarah replied softly.
Joe laughed. “That’s ok. Your guesses can be any worse than these bozo’s.”
Evan threw a roll back at Joe, mimicking the earlier exchange between him and Liz. Sarah leaned in, whispering to Evan, “You don’t think it’s Guido, do you?”
“No, I’m sure it’s not Guido; he’s in Philadelphia,” Evan chuckled, causing Liz and Joe to join in the laughter.
Sarah felt a wave of relief, just as a knock on the door refocused everyone’s attention. Joe was visibly proud of his secret as he walked to the door, instructing everyone to stay seated. With an air of dramatic flair, he opened the door but strategically positioned his body to block the view.
Sarah felt a surge of anticipation. Her heartbeat quickened, and she realized she was now emotionally invested in the mystery.
Finally, Joe stepped aside, revealing the long-awaited guest.

        <Text>Sarah was surprised at how vested she was in this mystery reveal without even knowing who had walked through the door. She found herself rising from her seat, performing a miniature hand clap, her eyes wide with infectious joy. Liz and Evan, in an uncanny display of sibling synchrony, had sprung from their chairs screaming, *It's Mom, it's Mom!* The force of their twin hug could have knocked their mother to the ground. Instead, it merely nudged her back a few steps, their love serving as a sturdy anchor. Joe stood off to the side, his face a portrait of pride and satisfaction.
Sarah remained standing, her hands still clapping softly. She couldn't help but get swept up in the tidal wave of raw emotion that was filling the room. Though she didn't share their history, she was touched by their undeniable love for each other.
Evan was thrilled, his eyes twinkling, yet more composed than his sister. His mother was fighting back tears, her eyes moist with joy and surprise.
After several heartwarming minutes of embraces and cheek-kissing, Bridget turned to Joe, wrapping him in a hug and pecking his cheek in gratitude. Evan joined in, their manly handshake transforming into a one-armed hug. Liz caught Joe's eyes, her gaze filled with immense love and gratitude. Their shared hug and soft kiss seemed to wrap up a perfectly orchestrated surprise.
Evan beckoned Sarah closer. &quot;This is Sarah. The woman I'm madly in love with. Sarah, this is my mom, Bridget!&quot;
Hearing Evan profess his love for her so openly in front of his mother, a stranger to her, stirred a cocktail of emotions within Sarah. A flicker of awkwardness tugged at her as if he'd bared something deeply personal in a public space. Yet, mingled with that was a feeling she could only liken to the warmth of being wrapped in a cherished old blanket; it felt genuine, and it made her see Evan in a light that softened all edges of her initial discomfort.
As Sarah extended her hand for a polite handshake, Bridget chuckled softly, joined by others in the room. &quot;Oh, dear. This family doesn't greet our loved ones with handshakes. We are a family of huggers.&quot;
Sarah felt a warm embrace envelop her. It felt welcoming, familiar, like something she'd been missing without knowing it.
&quot;Let's all sit down and finish our meals,&quot; Evan announced, directing his mother toward her chair. &quot;I can't wait to hear how you pulled this off.&quot;
&quot;Nonsense. You sit down next to your lovely girlfriend; I can serve myself,&quot; Bridget countered, taking control of the kitchen as if she'd lived there for years.
Sarah felt a surge of warmth envelop her. *What is happening to me?* Before she knew it, she'd reached for Liz and Evan's hands, squeezing them tightly. &quot;I'm so happy for you.&quot;
Joe and Bridget went on to explain how they'd orchestrated the whole surprise. The plan was based on cunningly false information about the cruise dates. Bridget could only stay until Christmas evening, needing to catch her real cruise. Throughout this explanation, Sarah sensed that Joe might have something else up his sleeve, but she couldn't put her finger on it.
As the evening progressed, Bridget turned her gaze towards Sarah, eyes filled with the wisdom and scrutiny only a mother could have. &quot;So, this is 'the one.'&quot;
Liz shot her mom a cautionary look, and Bridget seamlessly adjusted her wording. &quot;The one I've been hearing about so much lately.&quot;
&quot;I suppose that would be me,&quot; Sarah replied, a slight smile forming on her lips.
&quot;Madly in love, you say?&quot; Bridget turned towards Evan.
&quot;Madly, in love,&quot; Evan emphasized, sealing his words with an impassioned look.
Sarah felt an uncanny shift within her. She had gone from a distant observer to a part of something bigger, a part of this close-knit, loving family. And as Bridget asked her, in a voice dripping with maternal warmth, if she was &quot;madly in love&quot; with her son, Sarah didn't hesitate.
&quot;How could I not be? To answer your question, I am madly in love with your son.&quot;
Touched by her open vulnerability, Liz brought her hands to her heart. Evan leaned over and kissed Sarah softly on her lips.
Satisfied, Bridget returned to her meal, her gaze lingering just a moment longer on Sarah before she took a sip of her wine. And as if on cue, everyone else returned to their meals, an unspoken agreement that they were, in that moment, a complete family.
**Author's Style: Deep third-person limited, focusing on Sarah. The writing aims for emotional resonance, mixing action with heavy dialogue and moderate internal monologue to create an immersive experience.**</Text>
