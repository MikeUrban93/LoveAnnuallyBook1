        <Text>Scene Description:
Scene Name: 0135 Guido Hears the Big News
Characters: Evan, Guido
POV: Third person limited, from Evan's perspective 
Location: Guido's Car - Honda Civic
Tone: Celebratory, Anticipatory
Weather: Not relevant for this scene
Special Instructions: 
In the sequence of events section, I provide some ideas of what might be done and said. You have full discretion to write this scene the way you feel works best.
Sequence of Events:
The scene begins in Evan's and Guido's apartment. 
They are late for their for work. Evan needs to be there in time because he has a client session scheduled at 6 o'clock – his schedule start time is personal trainer.
Guido doesn't have anything until seven. He's taking even more time than usual in the bathroom making sure every air is in place. There is a new female personal trainer that we do want to impress.
Evan is anxious because he does will be late for his client session. More importantly, he wants Guido hurry up so he can tell Guido all about his day with Sarah. He knows there's no point in telling Guido when Guido's admiring himself in the mirror.
It's Guido's turn to drive today. On the ride to the gym Evan relives his experience with Sarah.
Guido listens to his friend is best he can, but he is a little concerned how obsessed Evan is with this girl. Guido's never seen obsessed with any girl. 
Evan is begging Guido for ideas on how to make the date special. Guido looks at his family's crazy. 
Guido: “How what I know what special is? Special to me is I spend the night.”
Just starts naming things anyone would think of. Candy, Flowers, A bottle of wine, lingerie
Evan keeps shooting down for one reason or another. Either the gift is cliché and not special enough, or it's not appropriate for first date.
Eventually Guido gets irritated and says, &quot;I don't know dude you're asking the wrong guy. Get your act together dude, or she is going to ditch you 10 minutes into the date. You better play cool like ‘The Guido’”
Evan acknowledges that Guido has somewhat of a point. He is acting hyper enthusiastic. 
Guido said, &quot;Look bro, I'm glad you got a date with this girl. But from what I hear, he's a bit mature for her age.&quot; 
Evan asked what does that that even mean. 
Guido tells him it means she wants a cool sophisticated dude. You better get your act together before Thursday.
Guido continues. Rumor is she is some sort of high-class society girl that wouldn’t give the college the time of day. I hear she only dates older men–
Evan interrupted, that's not true–
Guido interrupts back. It doesn't matter dude. She's clearly not the like the girls you I are used to hanging out with. If you want to get her something special, then you gotta realize what special her like a Gucci purse, or expensive shoes, or jewelry –
[[ guido pulls into the gym ]]
[[Evan interrupts Guido after he says jewelry. ]]
That's it! You're a genius, dude.
[[Words Guido loves to hear]]
Guido asks what are you going to get her?
[[They get out of the car and head to the entrance of the gym]]
Evan says, I don't know. I'll go to the mall tomorrow and look for inspiration.
