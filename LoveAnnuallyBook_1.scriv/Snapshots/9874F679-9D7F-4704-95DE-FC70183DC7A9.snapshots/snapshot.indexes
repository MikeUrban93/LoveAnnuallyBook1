        <Text>&quot;You must be Guido.&quot; Katie's voice held amusement.
&quot;Apparently, my reputation precedes me. You seem to know about me, but I know nothing about you. Let's sit together at lunch and fix such a travesty of justice.&quot;
&quot;Um. I am pretty sure my boyfriend would not approve,&quot; Katie replied, finding Guido comical and harmless.
Guido wasn't easily dissuaded. &quot;Hmm, a boyfriend, you say. Is it serious?&quot;
&quot;Very serious,&quot; Katie responded firmly, letting him know she was uninterested.
&quot;If you two ever break up -&quot; Guido began, only to be interrupted by Katie.
&quot;Never gonna happen,&quot; She said, waiving her index finger from side to side.
Evan watched Guido wander off, a smirk playing on his lips. He turned to Katie, his eyes twinkling with amusement. &quot;Nice job! You sent him packing in record time. I don't think I've ever seen Guido give up so easily.&quot;
Katie grinned, her eyes dancing with mischief. She playfully blew on her fingernails, curled her hand, and then rubbed her fingernails on her shirt, performing the theatrical expression with flair. &quot;Well, someone has to keep him in check. Might as well be me,&quot; she retorted, her voice laced with humor.
Evan laughed, appreciating her spirit. Together, they returned to the task at hand, their camaraderie strengthened by the shared moment of fun.</Text>
