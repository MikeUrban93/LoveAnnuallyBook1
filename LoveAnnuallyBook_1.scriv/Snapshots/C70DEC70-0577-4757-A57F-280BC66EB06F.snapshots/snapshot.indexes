Title: Sarah Relaxes in the Tub
Summary:
After discovering Sarah's room key and note that a staff member slipped under his hotel room door, Evan's heart races with anticipation. He enters her room to find her alluringly awaiting him under the covers, her eyes filled with desire and trust. In this intimate and profound moment, Sarah finally declares her love for him, words that he has longed to hear. Their connection deepens as they make love, not just a physical union but a cementing of their emotional bond, forging a connection that neither of them had ever felt before.

The scene closed with Evan's joyous and excited reaction to this unexpected but welcome revelation.

Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
After Nina had left to deliver the envelope to Evan, an immediate shot of fear consumed Sarah. Inexperienced in true intimacy within a loving relationship, she was at a loss for what to do. Uncertain of what to wear or where to position herself as she awaited Evan's arrival, she was gripped by indecision and doubt.
She thought to herself, If only I had planned this ahead of time, I would have purchased elegant lingerie for the moment. But none of what I have will suffice.
Ultimately, she decided to undress completely and lie in bed beneath the covers, with both the sheet and comforter pulled up over her chest. Her choice was marked by caution, as she was nervous about revealing too much of her body, and it reflected the genuine, vulnerable anticipation she felt for this significant step in their relationship.
Middle:
Sarah's nerves rise to a peak, as she hears the key card on locking the door with the sound of a click that seemed to echo loudly in the room.
Evan entered slowly and gently closed the door.
[ When Evan sees Sarah looking at the door, describe the detail of a romance novelist, his reaction to seeing his beautiful love awaiting him. ]
Evan smiles and looks at Sarah. 
She nervously smiled back.
Evan presumed that she was fully undressed hiding under the blanket, so he undressed and slid under the blanket next to her.
Sarah laid rigid and stiff, with her hands tightly holding the blanket in position. Evan leaned in and kissed her gently.
Evan's kiss did not free Sarah from her nearly petrified state of anxiety.
Evan encouraged her to relax and let her know that everything was going to be okay.
Seeing she was so nervous, he asked Sarah what was the cause of her anxiousness.
Sarah: &quot;I don't have experience making love. I don't think I'm going to be any good at it, at least not the first time.&quot; 
[ Evan chuckled, finding Sarah's comments adorably amusing. ]
Evan: &quot;Before we kissed for the first time, did you think you weren't going to be any good at kissing?&quot;
[ Evan's question caused Sarah to think for a moment, causing her body to relax a little bit as she contemplated the question. ]
Sarah: &quot;I didn't have time to think about it. The kiss happened naturally.&quot;
[ Sarah paused and then continued. ]
Sarah: &quot;If I had thought about it, I would have presumed, having little experience, that I would not have been a very good kisser.&quot;
[ Evan smiled, hoping Sarah got his point. ]
Evan: &quot;Let me tell you. That kiss and every kiss since has been amazing. However it goes tonight, it's going to be incredible. Because, I love you and that's what matters.”
[ Evan's words comforted Sarah and melted her simultaneously. Her whole body relaxed and she was ready. Ready not just to make love but to finally say the words that Evan promised to cherish. Sarah's eyes watered. ]
Sarah: &quot;I love you too, Evan. I love you so much!&quot;
[ No verbal response from Evan was needed. His facial expression and smile told the story. ]
End: 
[ This book is not erotica. However, I would like the end of this scene to be written in the style of a romance novelist. ]
Sarah released her tight grip on the covers and relaxed her arms.
She and Evan kissed soft and sensually, while Evan's hands explored her body, feeling the softness of her skin, causing her body to tingle and yearn for more.
She found her hands naturally exploring Evan's body. Almost as if her hands had a mind of their own. The feel of his sculpted body increased her desire dramatically.
Finally, the moment was right. Evan and Sarah made soft sensual love for the first time.
