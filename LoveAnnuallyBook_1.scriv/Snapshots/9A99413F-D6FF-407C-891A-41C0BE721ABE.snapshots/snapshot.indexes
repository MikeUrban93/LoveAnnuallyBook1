[ Get me started on this scene. Using what you know, write a scene where Joe, now more confident than he is nervous, pretends to find one final present under the tree. He walks up to Liz, Kneels before her and asks her to marry him.

Keep in mind were still in Sarah's, deep POV. After having lost the battle to her tear bursts when Liz saw Evan's grades, her defenses were completely down. She was not prepared, because she thought all the emotional events of the day the were over. But oh how Sarah was wrong.

Joe proposed, tears flowing from his eyes as he did. Bridget cried, Liz cried, even tears came to Evan's eyes. Sarah's the tears started to flow up once more, Sarah surrendered thinking &quot;Screw it. Since I can't control it, I might as well embrace it.&quot; And she did. Sarah let herself cry and she enjoyed Liz's moment along with her. She was family after all. In the short time that she knew Liz, she developed a great respect and care for Liz. She couldn't be happier for this moment in Liz's life.

Please rewrite the scene as best you can, feel free to say expand well beyond what I've written here.

I want to do something a little different with the end of the scene. Let's append a paragraph where we relax the reader a little bit. Just talk about how everyone congratulated Liz and Joe. Have Liz give a close-up look at her ring to Sarah. The kind of things that normally happen right after of proposals accepted.

So after bringing everyone down from an emotional high to just a feel-good state. I want to end the scene with little bit of humor.

Much to Joe's chagrin, Sarah can't help her curiosity. She says out loud, &quot;I just have one question.&quot; Everybody's curious what that might be, assuming it's related to the proposal.

Sarah said, &quot;I'm dying to know. What the heck is the name of this movie were going to watch. &quot;

Evan, Liz, Bridget all laugh out loud. Joe buried his face is hands shaking his head from side to side. He was hoping that the proposal might spare him yet another watching of the movie.

Liz, Bridget, Evan look at each other and simultaneously deliver the name of the movie out loud. &quot;White Christmas&quot;

        <Text>Just when Sarah thought the emotional rollercoaster had reached its final stop, Joe started shuffling around the base of the Christmas tree, his movements oddly deliberate. *What is he doing?* she wondered, feeling her gut tighten. She was still recovering from the earlier emotional outpourings, feeling exposed and vulnerable.
&quot;Ah, what do we have here?&quot; Joe pretended to discover something under the tree. With a suspiciously neat package in hand, he walked over to Liz. Sarah watched in slow motion as Joe dropped to one knee in front of her.
Time itself seemed to slow. The room was dead silent except for the muted Christmas music playing in the background. Sarah felt her heart pounding, her eyes widening, as Joe looked up at Liz, his own eyes shimmering with a mix of hope and vulnerability.
&quot;Liz, I've spent a lifetime waiting for someone like you,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with emotion. &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;
The room exploded into a chorus of sobs and gasps. Liz burst into tears, nodding furiously as Joe slipped the ring onto her finger. Evan wiped his eyes, the emotional armor he usually wore now completely shattered. Bridget was a crying mess, clutching a tissue to her face.
And then there was Sarah. Tears welled up, breaking all the dams she had built in her mind. *Screw it,* she thought. *Since I can't control it, I might as well embrace it.* And embrace it she did. Tears cascaded down her cheeks, but for the first time that day, she welcomed them.
As Liz and Joe shared their tearful kiss, Sarah allowed herself to revel in the moment. The pure, uninhibited joy. In the short time she'd known Liz, she had grown incredibly fond of her. This was a woman who had opened her home to Sarah, who had treated Evan like a son, and who had just given her something precious--a family.
Sarah felt grateful, humbled, and profoundly connected to everyone in that room. She had lost her battle against her tears, but in that surrender, she found something much more valuable: a sense of belonging, of unconditional love, and a newfound appreciation for the messy but beautiful tapestry of human emotion.
After the emotional intensity of Joe's proposal and acceptance, the room shifted to a quieter, more contented buzz. Congratulatory hugs were exchanged, hands were shaken, and cheerful chatter filled the room. Liz floated over to Sarah, her ring glittering in the light. &quot;Look at this beauty, would you?&quot; Liz whispered, holding out her hand so Sarah could get a close-up view. &quot;Isn't it just perfect?&quot;
Sarah grinned, admiring the ring. &quot;Absolutely stunning, Liz. He did good.&quot;
Just as everyone seemed to settle into this new, happy reality, Sarah's voice pierced the warm ambiance. &quot;I just have one question.&quot;
Every eye turned her way, tension momentarily building again. Perhaps she was about to ask something serious, something related to the life-altering moment that had just occurred?
Sarah grinned mischievously. &quot;I'm dying to know. What the heck is the name of this movie we're going to watch?&quot;
The room erupted into laughter. Evan, Liz, and Bridget burst out in unison, unable to hold back their chuckles. Joe, however, buried his face in his hands, shaking his head from side to side. He had been secretly hoping that the grandiosity of his proposal would spare him another viewing of the infamous film.
Liz, Bridget, and Evan exchanged glances and then, in perfect unison, declared, &quot;White Christmas.&quot;</Text>
