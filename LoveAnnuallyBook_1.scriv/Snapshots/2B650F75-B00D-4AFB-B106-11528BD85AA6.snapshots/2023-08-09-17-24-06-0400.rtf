\par\plain {\f1\fs28\b1\i0 Characters: }{\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Evan, Sarah}
\par\plain {\f1\fs28\b1\i0 POV:}{\f0\fs28\b0\i0  Third person limited, from Sarah's perspective }
\par\plain {\f1\fs28\b1\i0 Back story}{\f0\fs28\b0\i0 : Last Thursday evening marked the beginning of Evan and Sarah's formal relationship, solidified by a pact that resembled a contract. They outlined commitments to one another, with Sarah agreeing to attend as many of Evan's Sunday morning softball games as possible.}
\par\pard\plain \tx0\fi360\sa120\sb120\sl262\slmult1\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 The evening was made even more special when Evan presented Sarah with an extraordinary gift. Finding a vintage doll adorned with tiny glasses, he enlisted a jeweler to coat the glasses in silver and fashion them into a pendant for a beautiful necklace. The sentiment of the gift resonated deeply with Sarah. She was so enamored with the unique creation that she requested to keep the vintage doll. Her request further bonded their newly forged connection.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Before meeting Evan, Sarah's wardrobe consisted mainly of business suits and designer gowns. Casual clothing was foreign to her. That was about to change when she befriended Katie, one of her Business-101 students. With the aid of her hairstylist Nicole, Katie gave Sarah a complete makeover for her date with Evan.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Sarah shared with Katie the unique contract-style relationship with Evan, including her commitments to attend his softball games and college parties, a stark contrast to her usual upscale philanthropic events.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Wanting to help Sarah blend in with Evan's friends and the college crowd, Katie and Sarah embarked on a shopping spree the Saturday before the softball game. The outing was a success, and Sarah's closet became fully equipped with the casual clothes typical of college students, symbolizing a transformation not just in her appearance but in her life's direction.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs28\b0\i0 Another critical point to understand in this scene is that Sarah clarified that academics always come first in this scene, which leads to a funny moment. However, it also shows how Evan fully supports Sarah's academic priorities.}
