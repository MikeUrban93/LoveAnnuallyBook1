What motivates this character? 
Money and sex are Guido's primary motivations.
How does the character change by the end of the novel? 
In the first book, Guido's character doesn't undergo much transformation. However, a significant evolution can be seen in the sequel when he encounters love in the unlikely form of the woman who assists Evan in selecting a ring for Chloe. Dakota is drawn to Guido, yet she remains cautious. She sets a condition: she will only consider dating him if he can remember her name by the time Chloe and Evan have set a wedding date.
Chloe's bestseller brings Guido his fleeting moment of fame, pulling him into a whirlwind of attention from countless attractive women. 
When Chloe and Evan's wedding date is set, a self-assured Guido saunters into the jewelry store, anticipating Dakota's admiration fueled by his newfound fame. Regrettably for him, his amplified ego and wild cockiness repel her. While she considers his rough-around-the-edges persona attractive, she is put off by the arrogant man who stands before her. She had been attracted to the man who supported his best friend, Evan, in his time of need, not the conceited character she now encounters.
His rejection prompts Guido to reconsider his approach to women. He's grown weary of fleeting affairs and finds himself genuinely drawn to Dakota. Although she might not possess the conventional beauty of the women drawn to him during his period of fame, Guido finds her more appealing than any of them. 
This leads him to a pivotal realization: he no longer wants to be &quot;Guido.&quot; Instead, he wants to be Anthony, hoping for a future with Dakota. In return, Dakota wishes for exclusivity with Guido. Yet she's content with who he is, with no desire to alter or control him.
With his &quot;Guido&quot; persona put to rest, Anthony now yearns for a committed relationship with just one woman, laying the foundation for a deeper, more meaningful love story in the next chapter of his life.
What is the character's role in the novel?
Guido is Evan's best friend throughout the story.
Guido is a member of the poker gang that helped develop the &quot;Love, Annually&quot; relationship rules.
At times he offers comic relief, and other times he offers support for various characters in the story.
Character Arc: 
Guido's character arc spans from a university student and carefree bachelor to a committed partner and executive manager, showcasing significant personal and professional growth.
When we first meet Guido, he is a college student rooming with Evan at the University of Illinois. He's characterized by his zest for life and propensity for partying. After graduation, eager to remain close to his friend, he moves to the Chicagoland area, landing an entry-level job at a prestigious money-management firm. His ambition, determination, and undeniable skill in finance see him climb the corporate ladder swiftly, landing him an executive finance manager position with a six-figure income.
Meanwhile, his personal life embodies the traits of a stereotypical bachelor — carefree and promiscuous. Yet, there's more to Guido than his lifestyle suggests. He is a steadfast friend to Evan and Liz, always there in their times of need. His willingness to help Evan, in particular, not just emotionally but also financially by contributing his time and resources to Evan's foundation, hints at a depth of character beneath his wild exterior.
His turning point comes when he meets Dakota. Until then, Guido has been content with his casual relationships, but with Dakota, he feels something different. It's a slow transformation — he struggles to reconcile his habitual bravado with the genuine affection he feels for Dakota, who is unlike any woman he's been with before.
After a humbling rejection, Guido is forced to reevaluate his relationships with women. He grows tired of his one-night stands, yearning for something deeper. It's a revelation that leads him away from his 'Guido' persona and towards a more authentic self — Anthony. The growth culminates in his heartful proposal to Dakota at Evan and Chloe's wedding reception. 
By the end of the narrative, Guido, now Anthony, has transitioned from a flirtatious bachelor to a dedicated partner ready to embark on a shared life with Dakota. Although his story isn't further explored in the narrative, his journey from a wild-hearted young man to a dedicated friend and loving partner is a fulfilling arc that portrays personal growth and maturity.
