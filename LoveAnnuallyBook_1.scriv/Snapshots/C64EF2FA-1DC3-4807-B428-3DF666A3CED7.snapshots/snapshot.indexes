        <Title>Cleaned Up Dialogue</Title>
        <Text>The Thai Garden Restaurant was a hidden gem, tucked away in a bustling part of town. As Sarah stood outside, she could see the glow of warm lanterns hanging from the ceiling and intricately carved wooden panels adorning the walls. Tables adorned with colorful silk tablecloths were spaced generously to create a sense of intimacy. Faint strains of traditional Thai music whispered through the air, mingling with the fragrant aroma of spices and herbs. A tasteful fountain at the center of the dining area added a gentle murmur, completing a sensory experience that promised a cozy, romantic atmosphere.
Through the window, she could see Evan texting on his phone, a sight that brought a flurry of emotions to her heart. Terrified, she thought, feeling a sudden incapability to maintain her no-dating rule. But Sarah was never truly out of control; even at this moment, she had a well-thought-out plan.
Her new dress ensemble, chosen with Katie's help, clung to her figure. It was an elegant blend of confidence and allure, something she hoped would strike the right note.
Evan waited anxiously, trying to find someone to text to help pass the time. He felt a presence over his shoulder and looked up, then back to his phone. A second later, he looked back again, his heart leaping as he realized it was Sarah. Seeing her brought a genuine smile to his face. Evan stood up and kissed Sarah, his lips gentle on her cheek.
“I almost didn’t recognize you. Did you do all this for me?” he asked, referring to her makeover.
“I was in the mood to change things up a bit,” Sarah replied, her eyes moving up and to the right, her lips curling into a sly grin.
“Looking for a change, are you? I hope that bodes well for me.” Evan laughed, his eyes twinkling.
“We’ll see,” she said, a hint of mystery in her voice.
“Let’s go eat!” Evan said, leading her to the table.
When they got to the table, Evan pulled out the seat for Sarah, his movements graceful and practiced. “Thank you. You are quite the gentleman,” she said, her voice soft.
“You look great! But you know you didn’t have to change anything for me. You are beautiful now; you’re as beautiful as when I first laid eyes on you,” Evan said, his voice sincere.
Their server appeared as Evan finished his compliment, ready to take their orders. After two classes of  Pinot Noir were ordered and delivered, Evan went with the Spicy Pad Thai, and Sarah settled on the Som Tam.
“I was worried you wouldn’t show up,” Evan said, his eyes searching hers.
“I told you I always keep my appointments,” she replied, catching herself. “Sorry, poor choice of words. Why don’t we start this date off with you telling me a little about yourself?”
Evan arched an eyebrow playfully. &quot;Now, are you looking for my full résumé, complete with professional references, or just a summary of my many academic achievements?&quot;
Sarah's eyes sparkled as she caught the joke. Even though it was a playful jab at her, she found it endearing. His sense of humor put her at ease.
Sarah burst into laughter, shaking her head. &quot;Ha ha, you're so funny! I promise, no more résumé recitations. Let's stick to the topics normally discussed on a first date.&quot;
Evan raised his glass, his eyes sparkling. &quot;Deal,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with genuine enthusiasm. &quot;Let's make this a night to remember.&quot;
Sarah's heart gave a little leap, and a warm, pleasurable sensation spread through her. She was beginning to feel truly comfortable with him, and the night seemed full of promise. With a smile, she reached out and clinked her glass to his, toasting to the sentiment.          
“Well, I’m a pretty simple guy,” Evan began, leaning back in his chair and casting a casual glance around the room. “I work as a personal trainer at the gym down the street. I like to play sports, hike, run, bike, anything that gets me outside. I enjoy hanging out with my friends. Anything else you want to know?”
His words painted a picture of an active and outgoing person who thrived on physical activities and enjoyed the company of others. Sarah's eyes were fixed on Evan, and she was keen to learn more.
“What’s your major? Are you a good student?” she asked, genuinely interested in understanding what motivated him academically.
Evan’s face turned slightly thoughtful. “I’m majoring in software development. I guess I’m a good student when I apply myself. At least, that’s what my sister would say. I promised her I would maintain at least a 3.0 GPA. I'm hovering around that level now.”
Sarah noted the reference to his sister, intrigued by how Evan’s expression softened at the mention of her. “Are you close to your sister?”
Evan leaned back in his chair, his eyes momentarily distant as he considered the question. “Yes, but she’s in Chicago right now, so I don’t see her as often as I’d like. That’s where I’m from. How about you? What’s your story? Where are you from?&quot;
“I grew up in Seattle, no siblings. I’m a business major focusing on international trade, a teacher’s assistant, and I'm in the running for graduating at the top of our class,&quot; Sarah replied, her voice steady and confident.
The conversation flowed naturally, each question opening up new avenues for exploration. Evan's curiosity was piqued, and he asked, “If you don’t mind me asking, I get the impression that you could’ve gone to any university you wanted to. Why would you pick the University of Illinois?”
“My father owns a large corporation. He was a self-made man from modest beginnings. He went to U of I, and our agreement was I would follow in his footsteps and get my Bachelor’s degree here. After graduation, I plan to attend an Ivy League college for my master’s degree.&quot; 
Evan's eyes sparkled with interest as he leaned forward, “That’s very interesting. Do you have a job?”
As Sarah opened her mouth to reply, their food arrived, pausing the conversation. The server placed their plates on the table with a flourish, the aroma of the freshly cooked meals filling the air.
Sarah looked down at her plate, eyes widening. “This food looks and smells delicious!” She picked up her fork and took a bite, her face lighting up with delight. “It even tastes better than it looks. Excellent choice of restaurants!”
Evan grinned, pride in his selection evident. “I don’t get to come here very often, but I love their food,&quot; he said as he ate his meal, savoring the flavors.
Unperturbed by the interruption, Sarah continued their conversation, her voice filled with enthusiasm. “I don’t have a paying job, but I stay busy volunteering as an events coordinator for various nonprofit organizations in the area. During summer breaks, I intern for large corporations to gain experience.”
“I'm quite impressed!” Evan responded, his admiration genuine. “I like the idea of getting involved with non-profit organizations. It just seems like you should allow some time for fun.”
Sarah grinned and reminded Evan, her eyes twinkling, “I’m here with you, aren’t I?”
“Yes, you are! I'm happy about that,” Evan chuckled, raising his glass to toast their enjoyable evening.
They continued to eat, their conversation flowing effortlessly, the connection between them growing stronger with each passing moment. The laughter, the shared stories, and the pleasure in each other's company marked the date as something special, a chance encounter that held the promise of something more.
For dessert, Sarah ordered a small espresso while Evan chose a piece of strawberry cheesecake. The conversation continued with an air of intimacy, though the ambiance of the restaurant faded into the background as they focused on each other.
Sarah glanced down at her cup, then back at Evan. &quot;I was wondering if I could make a proposal?&quot;
Evan raised an eyebrow, a grin playing on his lips. &quot;A proposal already? We just met,&quot; he joked, then leaned forward, his eyes locking onto hers. &quot;Go ahead. I’m all ears.&quot;
Sarah's expression became thoughtful as she formulated her words. &quot;Since I met you, I have been reconsidering my thoughts on relationships. A relationship is a partnership. I wanted to propose that we form a partnership. In business, it is essential to identify all foreseeable issues before signing an agreement.&quot;
Evan's eyes narrowed thoughtfully, his head tilting to one side. “Interesting analogy. Go on, I’m listening.”
With a steadying breath, Sarah continued. “My father taught me it is best to lead with what I have to offer first, and here is what I can provide to this partnership. I can teach you some study techniques to improve your grades with minimal effort. I can already tell you’re going to want me to break out of my shell and socialize with your friends and others in my age group. I can’t promise I'll attend every party or social event, but I'll accompany you as often as possible, and if there is a particular event that is important to you, I’ll try to attend.”
Evan interrupted, putting down his fork. “May I ask a question?” Sarah nodded, and Evan continued, “I play softball every Sunday morning. Will you be able to come to my games?”
“My schedule is usually clear on Sunday mornings. I should be able to make it to many of your games,” Sarah replied, a reassuring smile gracing her lips.
Having Sarah at his games was an important point for Evan, evidenced by the excited look on his face. “Continue with your proposal,” he urged, leaning back in his chair.
“As adults in a romantic relationship, I expect some physical intimacy will be involved. I want to be honest with you here. I'm not a virgin, but I'm also not very experienced. I haven't been on a date since high school. You are quite attractive, and I'm interested in pursuing a physical relationship. I'll need you to be patient as I explore that aspect of myself. I expect you to wait until I'm ready.”
Evan's face softened, and he reached across the table, covering her hand with his, his expression earnest. “I appreciate your honesty, Sarah. Take all the time you need. I want this to be right for both of us.”
Sarah looked at Evan, her expression sincere. “The most important thing to me is that you understand my academic career comes first. That means no pressuring me to go to parties or spend time together until after I’ve attended to my studies. I attend a lot of formal events. Just as I'll attend your social events, I expect the same in return. Keep in mind these aren’t frat parties.”
Evan's eyebrows shot up, and he leaned back in his chair, slightly taken aback. “Is that what you think I am, a frat boy?”
Sarah quickly reached out, touching Evan's hand. “I didn’t mean to imply that. I want to let you know you may have to dress up for some of these events. These events will also be a great way for you to make important business connections. Those connections may help you find a great job after graduation.”
The stern lines on Evan's face relaxed, replaced by curiosity. “Is making connections why you want me to attend these events?”
“No, it’s not just that,” Sarah replied, her voice softening. “I like you. It would honor me to have you by my side at any event. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you since the moment you kissed me. If we let our relationship develop organically, I may never regain my focus.”
Evan's eyes sparkled with emotion, his words carrying a warmth that made Sarah's heart skip a beat. “I feel the same. You’ve been the only thing on my mind for the last week. I can’t focus any better than you can. There’s something about you that is just so different and so special. It’s like, somehow, I already know it will work out. There’s nothing I want more than to call you my girlfriend.”
“That’s my proposal. Do you have a counter-proposal?” Sarah asked, looking expectantly at Evan.
Evan's eyes twinkled, and a broad smile spread across his face. He had no problem with Sarah’s less-than-romantic offer and voiced his approval. “No counter-proposal. I’m in total agreement!”
Sarah laughed, a sound that was light and genuine. “My father said if they accept your first offer, you offered too much.”
“Look at it from my point of view,” Evan retorted, his voice filled with good-natured amusement. “You said you would attend my games, you plan to explore your sexuality with me when you’re ready, you are going to hook me up with potential employers, and you can help me get good grades, which will make my sister happy. What more could I ask for?”
With a confident smile, Sarah put out her hand for a handshake. “So we have a deal?”
Evan's expression turned mischievous. “No way are we sealing this deal with a handshake.”
The implication of his words hung in the air, not so subtly hinting that it was time to leave the restaurant because he wanted to seal the deal with a kiss. A knowing smile danced in Sarah's eyes, and she felt a pleasant thrill at the prospect. The way Evan looked at her was enough to tell her he felt the same way.
He called for the check, paid it, and then stood up, offering his hand to Sarah. As they walked toward the restaurant's exit, their hands entwined, the air between them crackled with anticipation.</Text>
