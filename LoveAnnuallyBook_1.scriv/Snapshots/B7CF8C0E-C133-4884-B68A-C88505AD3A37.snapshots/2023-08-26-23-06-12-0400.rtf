\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 A melodious stream of late Christmas songs filled the air, infusing the apartment with festive warmth. Liz, adept at orchestrating gatherings, particularly relished intimate family moments during the holiday season. Amid the rhythmic sound of water running from the sink, she diligently cleansed a medley of fresh vegetables, each piece a precursor to the forthcoming feast.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Engrossed in her culinary preparation, Liz felt the familiar embrace of arms enveloping her from behind. Joe, her steadfast partner, pressed a gentle kiss against her neck, his affectionate gesture resonating through the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Joe's voice was laden with warmth. "Did I ever mention you're the most beautiful woman in the world?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Liz's eyes crinkled with a smile as she responded, her tone lighthearted and playful.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 "Yes, you've made that clear on numerous occasions. But don't let that stop you from saying it again."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Joe's expression held a hint of mischief as he leaned in, a silent request for a kiss.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Liz turned toward Joe, a mischievous glint in her eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 "And are you finally ready to unveil the identity of our enigmatic guest?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Joe responded with a teasing grin, keeping his secret close to his chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 "Sorry, love. You'll have to wait along with everyone else."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Liz playfully raised an eyebrow in response.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 "Then I guess you'll have to wait a bit longer for that kiss."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 With a swift peck on the tip of Joe's nose, Liz spun away, intent on returning to her culinary creations. Joe, however, responded with a gentle tickle, prompting her to face him once more. He adopted a playful tone, appealing for a well-deserved kiss.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Liz conceded with a chuckle, feigning reluctance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 "Fine, just one quick kiss."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 As their lips met, a fleeting connection charged with affection, the room held an atmosphere of shared joy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Liz's culinary responsibilities extended to crafting an array of sides, desserts, and a delectable dinner salad, each element adding to the anticipated symphony of flavors. Meanwhile, Joe embraced the task of overseeing the oversized turkey's journey to perfection. Positioned on the balcony of their second-floor apartment, the turkey was poised for a transformative encounter with Joe's skillful grilling techniques using his trusty Weber charcoal grill.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Amidst the culinary symphony, Liz paused to inquire about the progress of the turkey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 "How's our centerpiece coming along?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Joe, his focus divided between culinary craftsmanship and a basketball game on television, responded with a grin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 "It should be ready approximately an hour after our eager guests are set to arrive. Speaking of which, I expected Evan to be here by now. Any word from him?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 With a playful tap of her phone's screen, Liz shared a glimpse of Evan's recent dispatch \endash  vibrant images capturing the enchanting allure of Candy Cane Lane, a neighborhood renowned for its resplendent Christmas decorations.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Liz displayed the images. "Evan and Sarah decided to take a detour through Candy Cane Lane. He just messaged that they're heading over and should be here in about 15 minutes."}
\par\plain {\f0\fs26\b0\i0 Liz, aware of the ticking clock and her own busy schedule, offered Joe a choice: to join her in chopping vegetables or to oversee the turkey's progress while indulging in his basketball passion. Joe, ever the supportive partner, chose turkey duty, plucking a carrot on his way out.<!$Scr_Ps::0>}}
