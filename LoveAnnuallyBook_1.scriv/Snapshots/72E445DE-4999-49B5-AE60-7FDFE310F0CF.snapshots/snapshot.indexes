        <Text>The clock on the wall read 7:45 a.m., and the tension of expectation hung thick in the air. Liz and Evan sat across from each other at the dining room table, each stealing glances at the hallway as if trying to will their respective partners into view.
&quot;You’re probably going to win,&quot; Evan said, his fingers tapping against the wooden tabletop. &quot;Sarah was a little late to rise this morning.&quot;
&quot;I'm surprised Joe's not out here right now,&quot; Liz replied, taking a sip of her coffee. &quot;He’s been up since 6 a.m., restless. Said he couldn't sleep. He's been acting strange all morning--really, all week.&quot;
Evan shrugged. &quot;Probably because he was trying to keep it a secret about Mom’s visit.&quot;
&quot;That's what I thought, but he’s still acting weird, and there's no more secret,&quot; Liz said, her gaze lingering on the hallway.
*I wouldn't worry about it,* Evan thought. &quot;Sarah's not exactly herself this morning either,&quot; he said, just as footsteps echoed from the hallway.
Both siblings perked up, and Sarah emerged first. Evan jumped up with a triumphant grin. &quot;Ha, I win!&quot;
Sarah shot him a bewildered look as she walked past him to the coffee pot. &quot;What did I just walk into?&quot;
Seconds later, Joe appeared, eyes half-open but alert. He bypassed the gathering and headed straight for the coffee pot beside Sarah.
&quot;We've got a surprise for you,&quot; Liz announced, sharing a conspiratorial glance with Evan.
Joe and Sarah, leaning back against the kitchen counter, looked at them. Their faces were interested, though not nearly as animated as Liz and Evan’s--they were still shaking off the cobwebs of sleep.
Evan grabbed one curtain, Liz the other. A silent nod between them, and they whisked the curtains apart to reveal the large patio doors, behind which lay a blanket of fresh snow, eight inches deep.
Liz squealed in delight, her eyes sparkling like the snowflakes outside. Evan's mind raced through various snowman designs, each more elaborate than the last.
&quot;See, I told you it was going to snow today,&quot; Joe said, finally waking up a bit more.
&quot;You did tell me that!&quot; Liz lunged at Joe and planted a big, resounding kiss on his lips.
A knock on the door broke the moment. Evan and Liz turned, and as if sharing a brain, both exclaimed, &quot;Mom's here!&quot;
And just like that, the last piece fell into place. The family was all gathered, and it was finally time for the gift-opening ritual to begin.
*So far, so good,* Sarah thought, letting out a breath she didn't know she'd been holding. *Last night's emotional hiccup was a one-time thing. I'm ready now. And I've got no more tears left to cry, anyway.*

        <Text>It was 7:45 a.m., a quarter hour before the agreed-upon gift-opening time, and Liz and Evan sat at the dining room table, each sneaking glances down the hallway with a sense of anticipation. The air held a mix of excitement and impatience, like a pot ready to boil over.
Evan broke the silence, his eyes still lingering on the hallway. &quot;Liz, I'd like you to open the gift from Sarah and me last. If that's okay?&quot;
Liz chuckled. &quot;I didn't know money was so tight, Evan. You didn't have to get me anything. But of course, I'll open it last if you'd like.&quot;
&quot;The good news is the gift for you didn't cost a penny.&quot;
&quot;Hmm, a priceless gift you say. Color me curious,&quot; Liz responded, now genuinely intrigued.
Their attention shifted back to the subject at hand. &quot;You're probably going to win,&quot; Evan finally said, thinking of Sarah's tardiness in mornings. &quot;Sarah was a little late to rise today.&quot;
&quot;I'm surprised Joe's not out here right now,&quot; Liz mused, worry tingeing her voice. &quot;He's been up since 6 a.m., restless. He's been acting strange all morning--really, all week.&quot;
Joe had been jittery, his actions tinged with an uncharacteristic urgency. Evan weighed his sister's words for a moment before replying, &quot;Probably because he was trying to keep it a secret about Mom’s visit.&quot;
&quot;That's what I thought too,&quot; Liz sighed, &quot;but he’s still acting weird, even though the secret is out.&quot;
Before Evan could reply, the sound of footsteps echoed down the hall. Sarah was the first to appear. Evan jumped from his seat, pumping his fist. &quot;Yes! Bragging rights for a year!&quot;
Sarah raised an eyebrow, her face a picture of bewilderment, as she moved straight to the coffee pot. &quot;Do I want to know what I just walked into?&quot;
Joe emerged just moments later, eyes fully alert but his hands visibly trembling--a telltale sign of nervous energy. He too made a beeline for the coffee pot.
&quot;We've got a surprise for you,&quot; Liz proclaimed, locking eyes with Evan.
Liz and Evan each grabbed a curtain, casting a shared nod before yanking them open. Beyond the glass patio doors lay eight inches of pristine snow.
Liz's face lit up, a radiant blend of childlike joy and adult wonder. Beside her, Evan's imagination kicked into overdrive, scheming up snowmen of various shapes and sizes.
&quot;See, I told you it was going to snow today,&quot; Joe said, his voice steadier now.
&quot;You did tell me that!&quot; Liz bounded over to Joe and planted a jubilant kiss on his lips. The jitteriness seemed to ebb away from him, if only for that moment.
A knock echoed from the door, pulling everyone's attention. Liz and Evan looked at each other and in a synchronized voice declared, &quot;Mom's here!&quot;
As the last family member arrived, the stage was set for the day's main event--the opening of the gifts.
Sarah took a deep breath, steadying herself. *Whatever is in those wrapped boxes can't be more surprising than last night,* she thought. *I'm ready now. For whatever comes next.*</Text>
