        <Text>With their cleanup duties complete, Evan and Sarah had to go to the living room for the Christmas Eve gift opening.
[ I'm going to have you write the narrative for the various gifts everybody might've gotten or write a general narrative about how everybody enjoyed their gift-opening experience. It's not very important to the story. Christmas music playing in the background, etc. ] 
After all the gifts were opened, Bridget asked if anybody minded if she retired to her hotel for the evening. She was exhausted from traveling and the exciting day. Liz reminded her Mom to return before 8 a.m. That was the time the Christmas morning gift opening was to commence.
After a round of goodbye hugs from everyone, Liz opened the door for her mom and said good night. Before she closed the door, she looked up at the sky.
Evan (hopeful): “Any signs of snow, Liz?”  
Liz (making a pouty face): “Unfortunately not. I was really hoping for a white Christmas this year.”  
Joe (trying to be optimistic): “I heard the weatherman say there's a slight chance of snow tomorrow.”  
Liz: “They always say that. We haven't had a white Christmas in three years.”  
Evan: “I think Sarah and I are gonna head to our bedroom and get some rest. I want to make sure I'm well-rested for tomorrow!”  
Sarah (sincere): “I know you already opened your Christmas Eve present, Evan. Would it be a severe violation of tradition if I were to give you a second present this evening?”  
Evan looked at Liz—the decision-maker of the family.
Liz could see in Sarah's eyes this was important to her.
Liz (being supportive): “No, there are no such rigid restrictions in our traditions.”  
Joe (chimed in, hoping for a reprieve): “Does that mean I'll have to watch that movie again tomorrow!?”  
Liz (chuckled): “Except for that tradition.” 
Joe feigned a disappointed face. 
Sarah (grateful and excited): “Awesome! Thank you so much. I'll be right back.”  
Evan (face curled in confusion and surprise): “Did Sarah just use the word awesome?”  
Liz and Joe laughed at Evan's sincere surprise.
Sarah returned a few minutes later with her laptop case in her left hand and her cell phone in her right hand. She handed them to Liz.
Everyone seemed confused.
Sarah (explained): “Put those somewhere safe, and do not tell me where they are. I don't care if I beg you or bribe you. Under no circumstances am I allowed to have those until the day after Christmas.”  
Evan (truly touched by Sarah's gesture): “Sarah, you don't have to do that.”  
Liz (sincere): “Your gesture is enough, Sarah. You'll get no judgment from this family. I agree with Evan. You do not have to do this.”  
Sarah (speaking softly as she looked into Evan's eyes): “I know I don't have to. That's why I want to.” 
Evan nodded to Liz, and she left to hide Sarah's laptop and phone. </Text>
