        <Title>b4 guido change</Title>
        <Text>Sarah and Evan entered Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill, immediately embraced by the lively energy of sports enthusiasts and the tantalizing aroma of a backyard barbeque. Memorabilia adorned the walls, flat-screen TVs displayed various games, and the gleaming bar beckoned with its wide selection of drinks. Evan's eyes sparkled with excitement as he gave the host Guido's name, and they were seated at a reserved table made of polished wood.
As they settled in, friends began to trickle in, their faces glowing with pride and joy. High-fives, hugs, and handshakes were exchanged, all with Evan at the center, the hero of the Enforcers' latest win.
Sarah forced a smile, trying to engage, but felt like an outsider. No one spoke to her. She glanced at the door, secretly hoping Patti would walk through, her one connection in this crowd. But Patti was a no-show.
*Where's Patti? She's the only one who talks to me.*
The thought was interrupted by the boisterous entrance of Guido, bragging about driving in the winning run, his voice rising above the din. The laughter and chatter escalated, the group reveling in the victory. The TV screens flashed with highlights, the faces of famous athletes watching over them, their victories immortalized on the walls.
But for Sarah, the laughter felt alienating, the noise overwhelming. She looked at Evan, so natural in this environment, so happy and proud. But she felt alone, disconnected.
&quot;Hey, where's Patti?&quot; Evan asked Roxanne, puzzled by her absence, as he always saw her and Roxanne together at gatherings like this.
Roxanne's eyes flickered to Sarah, a pointed glare in them, filled with unspoken blame. &quot;She wasn't feeling well,&quot; she said, her voice cool, letting the words hang in the air. Her gaze lingered on Sarah a moment longer, ensuring her message was delivered without saying it outright. The unspoken message was clear to Sarah, though Evan remained oblivious.
Sarah's heart sank. She had hoped that Patti might be her saving grace for the evening. She couldn't understand Roxanne's passive-aggressive glare implying it was Sarah's fault that Patti didn't show.
With no hope of a friendly face other than Evan's, Sarah picked at her food, the taste of the hearty bar fare lost on her, the vibrant setting fading into a blur.
The celebration continued, friends engaging with the memorabilia, commenting on the games, ensuring beers remained full. Guido was the life of the party, his loud voice filled with enthusiasm.
Sarah's thoughts drifted to her past, her lifelong struggle to connect. Her successes and failures always so clear-cut, so black-and-white. And now, at this moment, she felt like a failure. *Maybe I shouldn't have broken my number one rule.*
She leaned over to Evan, her voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Can we please leave?&quot;
They left shortly after dinner, Evan making excuses about studying, protecting Sarah from his friends' disappointment. His friends teased him, tried to persuade him, but Evan stuck to his decision to leave.
During the walk to the car, Sarah's emotions were in turmoil. She asked Evan to drive, holding back tears, refusing to cry from emotional duress.
&quot;It's common for someone new to the group to be less talkative,&quot; Evan reassured her, his voice gentle.
Upon arriving at Evan's apartment parking lot, Sarah exited the car and headed to the driver's side. Evan's warm, reassuring kiss, delivered just before she sat in the driver's seat, provided a momentary balm to her inner turmoil. But the lingering distress was far from resolved. She pretended to feel better, forcing a smile as she drove away, leaving Evan at his apartment. As she headed home, the silence in the car became a heavy burden, amplifying her mind's doubt and self-reproach. Her earlier feelings of isolation and failure were now her sole companions on the journey.
*Did I make a mistake with Evan? Maybe I shouldn't have entered this relationship with Evan. What was I thinking?*
The questions lingered as she drove on, the lively atmosphere of Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill a distant memory, her struggle to connect a present reality.</Text>

As they settled in, friends began to trickle in, their faces glowing with pride and joy. High-fives, hugs, and handshakes were exchanged. Shout-outs went to Evan for scoring the winning run in the Enforcers' latest win.

Where's Patti? She's the only one who talks to me.
The thought was interrupted by the larger-than-life entrance of Guido, who threw open his arms with flair and announced, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, your hero, the Guido, has arrived! Now we can kick this lame party into high gear!&quot; His voice rose above the din, his posture full of triumph and self-assurance.
Laughter and chatter escalated, the group reveling in the victory. The TV screens flashed with highlights, the faces of famous athletes watching over them, their successes immortalized on the walls.
