POV: Third person limited, deep (focusing on Sarah)
Dialogue Focus: Moderate
Use of Internal Dialogue: Heavy
Plot/Action:
Beginning: 
[ Mere seconds into their journey, Evan spots Marcus Chamberlain. Unable to resist his comic ways. ]
Evan: “Hey Sarah, Morgan Freeman showed up!”
Sarah: “Shh Evan, someone might hear you. Don’t look at him, I think we need to warm you up little bit before I introduce you.”
Marcus Chamberlain looked over at Sarah and Evan and began walking their way.
Evan: “Too late. Morgan is on his way. She asked for his autograph?”
Sarah was not amused by Evan’s jokes. She immediately flashed a smile she’s been practicing since she attended her first fundraiser at 12 years old. Out of the corner of her mouth.
Sarah [ whispered ]: “Be on your best behavior.”
Middle:
[ Marcus walks up and praises Sarah. ]
Marcus: “Sarah you’ve done a great job here. I’m very impressed!”
Sarah: “Thank you Mr. Chamberlain-”
[ Marcus interrupted and corrected her ]
Marcus: “Please not so formal, Marcus.”
Sarah: “Thank you Marcus for trusting me with such a prestigious event. I am honored to be associated with your organization.”
[ Curiously, Marcus looks at Evan. ]
Marcus: “Ah, a new face. Who have you brought with you today?”
Sarah: “This is my boyfriend, Evan?”
[ Marcus extends his hand. ]
Marcus: “Nice to meet you, Evan.”
[ Marcus and Evan engage in a firm, appropriate handshake. ]
Evan: “A pleasure to meet you as well, Marcus.”
[ Sarah is feeling good about how the conversation with Marcus and Evan started. ]
Marcus: “So, your Sarah’s boyfriend?”
Evan smiled: “My proudest accomplishment to date!”
[ Evan’s response caused Sarah concern, but Marcus gave a chuckle. ]
Marcus: “Have you had a chance to look at the items up for auction?”
Evan: “I took a quick peek on my way into the ballroom, I’d give my right arm for those Bears tickets on the 50 yard line!”
[ Sarah concern notched up to minor anxiety. She was trying to figure out a way to silently remind Evan to speak in a more distinguished way ]
Marcus: “Are you a Bears fan?”
[ Evan didn’t say anything but with wide open eyes made an exaggerated nod yes. ]
[ Evan’s animated facial expression and exaggerated nod increased Sarah’s concern and anxiety. ]
[ Marcus chuckled again. ]
Marcus: “It’s a blind auction. I think bidding starts in a few minutes. Who knows maybe you’ll have the winning bid.”
[ Unaware that Sarah was dying of anxiety inside hoping he didn’t say anything that would offend Marcus, continued his comic ways. ]
Evan: “You see this suit? It’s nice is in it?”
[ Evan talked on the lapels of his suit jacket as part of his humorist ways. ]
[ Marcus looked a bit confused. ]
Marcus: “Quite nice, yes.”
Evan [ joked ]: “I would love to bid on those tickets, but this suit represents the last dollar in my breakup.”
[ Although Evan’s statement was meant to be humorous, it was also very true. He drained his breakup for his fundraiser ensemble. ]
[ Sarah’s anxiety was nearing a crescendo. She just wanted to disappear. She couldn’t believe that Evan was joking in situation like this, but then something unexpected happened. Marcus cracked up at Evan’s joke. ]
Marcus: “Sarah, I love this guy he’s hilarious!”
[ Sarah remained paralyzed in her smile, unsure how to respond. ]
Marcus: “I understand. I was a young and always short on cash back in the day. But you know our organization does great work. Would you consider donating your time? We are always short on volunteers.”
Evan: “I would love to help out! Sarah was telling me about the great work ‘Home Is Where the Heart Is’ does.”
[ Evan’s statement slightly notched down Sarah’s anxiety. She thought now he is getting back on track. ]
[ Evan was proud of himself (in a cute way) that he remembered the name. ]
Marcus: “I’m glad to hear that! Sarah, can give you the details. She’s in charge of the project. Two weeks from today, we’re going to be helping folks clean up what’s left after a tornado hit a town, not far from where I believe you and Sarah attend college. Do you think you can make that Saturday?”
Evan: “Count me in! I’m pretty sure I can recruit a handful of friends to help volunteer as well.”
[ Sarah finally found her voice. Her anxiety was decreased – at least for the moment. She was excited about the thought that Evan would volunteer and recruit his friends. ]
Sarah: “Really? Who do you think will come?”
[ Evan rubbed his chin and thought. ]
Evan: “Patti is a lock! This is right up her alley, and wherever Patti goes Roxanne goes. I’m sure I can get Guido to commit, and I think I could convince three or four more friends to help out.”
Sarah: “Guido? I wouldn't think he'd be interested in volunteering.”
[ Sarah was surprised that Evan thought Guido would have any interest in volunteering on a project like this. ]
[ Evan looked at Marcus half serious,  half joking. ]
Evan: “Will there be single adult females volunteering?”
[ Marcus sees where Evan is going with this. He chuckled, and plays along. ]
Marcus: “I’m sure there will be plenty.”
Evan: “That’s a great incentive. We’ll add to that a six pack of beer for a job well done, and Guido will be in!”
[ Sarah wanted to crawl under a rock. She was certain this was not an appropriate thing to say to Marcus. But as before, the unexpected happened. ]
[ Marcus laughed even louder than be had before. ]
Marcus: “I can’t wait to meet this Guido fella.”
[ Evan comically rolled his eyes ]
Evan: “Believe me, you can wait.”
[ Marcus laughed even harder, his eyes began to water. Evan laughed along with him. ]
[ Finally Sarah let go of her fear. The conversation was not only going well, but well beyond her expectations. ]
Marcus: “Sarah, has the bidding started yet on the auction items?”
Sarah: “In 10 minutes?”
Marcus: “I’ll tell you what, young Evan. If you can recruit a few friends, and at least one Guido the Bears tickets are yours.”
[ Evan was shocked, thrilled, excited, grateful. He profusely thanked Marcus. ]
Evan: “Are you sure?”
Marcus: “I’m positive. A handful of young volunteers is worth much more than we’ll get at auction for those tickets.”
[ Marcus turned to Sarah. ]
Marcus: “Can you pull the Bears tickets off the auction table?”
[ Sarah didn’t know what to think or say. But they were his Bears tickets. He could do as he pleased. ]
Sarah: “I’ll go pull them right now.”
End: 
[ Sarah didn’t want to leave Evan there alone with Marcus Chamberlain of all people, but she didn’t know what else to do. ]
[ She left slowly and kept an ear out on the conversation. ]
Evan: “So tell me, Marcus. When are the Bears going to finally get a decent quarterback?”
Marcus: “Probably in the year 2000 never?”
Both men laughed, and other men started joining in on conversation talking about the Bears quarterback woes and am open to other sports related topics.
Eventually their voices faded into the background.
Objectives/Goals:
This scene shows Sarah realizing that Evan can still be himself and yet fit in to her world. This goes a long way in whittling away the remaining resistance Sarah has for going all in on the relationship.
Props/Items:
Bears tickets
