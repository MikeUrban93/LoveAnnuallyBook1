        <Text>In the heart of the University of Illinois, a sea of expectant eyes filled the Business-101 classroom. The tiered rows of maroon seats, mirroring the grandeur of a cinema, remained pointed towards the vacant podium at the room's center. The usually punctual Sarah Wilkins was absent, and the large space echoed with hushed whispers and speculation, stirring a mixed energy that bounced off the 30-foot ceiling and reverberated through the geometric artwork adorning the walls. 

Ten minutes past the hour, the door swung open, and Sarah hurried in. All conversation ceased. She wasn't the picture of poise they were accustomed to. Her glasses were absent, her hair wasn't constrained in its usual bun, and her eyes reflected a strange mix of exhilaration and panic. A silence swept the room, every student transfixed by the disheveled appearance of their usually impeccable teaching assistant.

“I apologize for being late. It will not happen again. Today we will review topics on next week’s exam,” Sarah announced, striding to the expansive whiteboard, her heart pounding as she tried to regain control. She wrote, her hand moving in long, practiced strokes, but the words she jotted were alien to the room.

&quot;Ms. Wilkins, we have never discussed that material,&quot; a student pointed out, and Sarah's heart sank. She had blundered, exposing her internal disarray.

Pausing, she took a deep breath, reminding herself to take charge of the moment. Instead of retreating behind her desk, she walked to the front, leaned against it, and faced her students, deciding to steer the ship in an entirely different direction.

“Did you ever have one of those days where something happens that you didn’t expect, and it throws you off your game?” Sarah's voice wavered slightly, but it was warmer, more human, drawing surprised smiles from her students. 

&quot;Today is one of those days for me.&quot; It was a confession, and it somehow brought her closer to them. The classroom hummed with intrigue. 

She launched into a fresh approach, highlighting the trick questions that would appear on the exam rather than focusing on rote memorization. Her voice carried through the room, the usual monotone replaced with an engaging tone that resonated with every student. 

At the end of the session, the students exited, leaving behind an air of satisfaction. Only one figure lingered behind, Katie Andrews, who walked up to Sarah with a beaming smile. 

“Ms. Wilkins, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed our class today. Whatever happened, I hope will happen again next week!” 

Sarah couldn't help the small smile tugging at her lips. &quot;Me Too!&quot; she thought, watching Katie leave, cherishing the spark of hope that today's frenzy might have had a silver lining.

        <Text>Sarah made her way into the Business-101 classroom at the University of Illinois, a familiar warmth flooding her veins at the sight of the room that had played host to countless academic victories. Rows upon rows of maroon theater-style seats sprawled out in a grand cascade, awaiting the day's youthful patrons. The fair sunlight poured in from the windows, casting an inviting glow on the polished wooden podium and the expansive whiteboard that dominated the front of the room. But today, the classroom would bear witness to a performance quite different from its usual fare.

A hush fell over the room as eyes darted towards the door, landing on a figure they had almost given up on seeing. Ten minutes late and glasses-free, Sarah stood in the doorway, her usually tied-back hair cascading freely down her shoulders. The sight of their punctual teacher's assistant, caught in this uncharacteristic moment, hung in the air like a suspended note in a symphony.

Striding forward with a steadying breath, Sarah adjusted her outfit and fixed a determined smile on her face. &quot;I apologize for being late,&quot; she addressed the silent sea of faces, her voice echoing off the tall ceilings. &quot;It will not happen again. Today we will review topics on next week’s exam.”

As she turned towards the whiteboard, the chalk in her hand began to fly across the expansive surface, outlining the next chapter's material before a confused voice called out, &quot;Ms. Wilkins, we have never discussed that material.&quot;

The world seemed to pause, Sarah standing frozen at the front of the room, Evan’s kiss still lingering on her lips and causing a ripple in her otherwise calm composure. She took a deep breath, her mind finally catching up to the fact that she had strayed off course in her lesson plan. *One of those days*, she thought, embracing the change and allowing it to guide her to a new destination.

The confident teacher’s assistant they had all grown accustomed to saw her façade begin to soften as she leaned casually against the front of her desk. “Did you ever have one of those days where something happens that you didn’t expect, and it throws you off your game?” she asked, her voice echoing with a raw honesty that drew everyone's attention.

The room was punctuated by a chorus of affirmative nods, the usually rigid air of the classroom filling with a soft empathy. &quot;Today is one of those days for me,&quot; Sarah confessed, her voice free from its usual rigidity, flowing like a calm river.

And so, Sarah, in her newfound authenticity, proposed a deviation from the normal course of study, focusing on the trickier aspects of the forthcoming exam. The unanimous agreement from her students fueled an energy within her, sparking a connection she had never felt before.

As the class ended, a burst of laughter and cheerful chatter filled the room, starkly different from the silence that usually marked the end of her lessons. A young woman with bright pink hair that shone under the room's soft lighting approached her. &quot;Ms. Wilkins, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed our class today. Whatever happened, I hope will happen again next week!”

Sarah's heart warmed at the thought. She looked at Katie, her eyes shining with a hint of shared understanding and gratitude, and thought, *Me too!*.

        <Text>The classroom was a microcosm of order and structure, juxtaposed with the youthful energy of the students filling it. As the wall clock ticked, the students' faces mirrored their confusion, their eyes flicking to the vacant podium, to the ticking clock, then back to the podium. Where was their punctual teacher's assistant, Sarah Wilkins? 
Then, the door swung open, and there she was, Sarah. Except she was different. Her usually neat hair was let down, her eyes were bare without the usual frame of glasses, and there was a flush to her cheeks that was never there before.
With a silent apology mirrored in her expression, she straightened her outfit, straightened herself, and stepped towards the podium. &quot;I apologize for being late. It will not happen again. Today we will review topics on next week’s exam,” she declared. Her voice, though steady, had an unfamiliar softness to it. 
While Sarah wrote on the board, a student raised his hand. &quot;Ms. Wilkins, we have never discussed that material,&quot; he pointed out. 
Sarah's eyes widened a tad, realization slowly dawning on her. There was a beat of silence before she let out a soft laugh, clearing her throat. “Did you ever have one of those days where something happens that you didn’t expect, and it throws you off your game?” she asked, leaning against her desk in a relaxed pose, the air around her lightening.
Nods and smiles of understanding echoed around the room. It was a rare glimpse of Sarah, the person, not just Sarah, their teacher's assistant.
“Today is one of those days for me,” she admitted, a touch of color staining her cheeks. “Let me tell you a secret about exams. 80% of the questions simply test your memorization. The other 20% are often trick questions to gauge how thoroughly you understand the material. Let's focus on the trick questions instead of wasting time on simple questions. I think this will give everybody a better chance to ace this exam. Is everyone agreeable to that?”
The room erupted in unanimous approval. For once, excitement echoed through the room, as opposed to the usual resignation. The rest of the class flowed easily, a stark difference from their usual sessions. 
As the class emptied, one student, Katie Andrews, approached Sarah. “Ms. Wilkins, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed our class today. Whatever happened, I hope will happen again next week!” 
The corner of Sarah's lips twitched upwards, her heart swelling in her chest. With a nod and a warm smile, she looked at Katie, her thoughts echoing Katie's sentiment. Me too, she thought. Me too.
